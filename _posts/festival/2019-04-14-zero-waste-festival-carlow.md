### Swap Shop

![Swap Shop](/images/events/2019-04-festival/carlow-swap-shop.jpg "Swap Shop"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 350px;"}

[EatGreenShopLess](https://www.instagram.com/eatgreenshopless/) is hosting another of our beloved Swap Shops where you get the opportunity to swap the clothes in your wardrobe that you no longer wear/love with other people's clothes. It gives you a chance to restyle your wardrobe.

##### Why swap?

The fast fashion industry is producing and disposing of millions of tonnes of clothing at an alarming rate. There are huge humanitarian, health and environmental costs to this. Here are [5 Truths about fast fashion](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/5-truths-the-fast-fashion_n_5690575) that you might not know.

##### How does it work?

We’ll be taking drop offs of clothes from 10-12. Swapshopping will begin officially at 12 to give us enough time to label and hang all your gorgeous bits of clothing.

Clothes will be labeled with "glam" or "rag" tags which you can swap for a corresponding token!
A max of 5 items can be dropped off and you will receive a token in return for each piece of clothing/shoes/bag. 
You’re asked to bring only good quality, clean clothes! 
The token will be reflective of the type of clothing given: dresses, jackets, skirts and nice tops will receive a "glam" token and regular jeans, jumpers and tops will get a "rag" token.
