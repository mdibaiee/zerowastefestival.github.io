The First Zero Waste Festival, which took place on 25th June 2017 at CIE Sports and Social Club, Inchicore Dublin 8, was a sell out success.

The venue and schedule were jam packed with everything from, talks, workshops, screenings and a Q&A, to info stands, vendors, meetups, swapshops and activities for children.

Here are some impressions from the Festival:
