## Tuesday - Coming Clean

### 6.30pm to 7.30pm Smells Like Clean Spirit Molly Aylesbury

While most of the ads will have you believing that you need to wage war on the germs in your house with a myriad of antibacterial and strong smelling chemicals, this is simply not the case. Bacteria will also succumb to hot water, pantry staples and a little elbow grease. Sorry Mr. Muscle! Join this workshop to learn how to make your own grime busting cleaners. From dealing with dirty clothes to the dreaded bathroom, say goodbye to stubborn stains and questionable cleaning products. Molly will show you how to have your kitchen scrubbed, your bathroom sparkling, your socks smelling delicious.

### 7.30pm to 8.30pm Alternative Haircare by AB Soap Studio

Join this talk if you would like to learn about hair care alternatives that do not come in plastic and consist merely of what nature has to offer. You will find out what herbs, botanicals and procedures would best suit your hair type and how you can make them yourself. We will also discuss no-poo, how to survive the dreaded “transition period” and how to best detox your hair.
This talk is free and you will be able to purchase loose ingredients, get your own freshly mixed hair care formula, or pick up a conditioning shampoo bar by AB studio - Clean Design.

### 5.30pm - 8.30pm Zero Waste Shopping

## Wednesday 

### 5pm to 7pm Make Your Own Cloth Bag with Sophie Rieu
Sophie Rieu is hosting a workshop on how to upcycle a piece of clothing into your own cloth bag. Why? When you buy loose fruit & veggies, dry goods or whatever takes your fancy, pop it in your cloth bag and avoid the plastic ones. We will provide the use of sewing machines, just bring a piece of clothing to transform and a sharp pair of scissors.

Sophie Rieu is a French fashion designer based in County Wicklow who has been creating sustainable fashion collections for 14 years. She has been passionate about all things green for as long as she can remember. Sophie has taught many upcycling classes so she is used to varied sewing skills.

### 6pm to 7pm Grow Your Own Veggie Garden with Andrew Jordan

Join us for an hour-long workshop where you can learn the basics - where to place your garden, what does the soil need, what are the best crops for starters and more! Andrew Jordan will show you how to become an urban gardener.

### 7pm to 8pm Rescue Meal Dinner - Food donated by Foodcloud

We would like to invite you to a food rescue meal and movie screening to raise awareness about food waste. The home-cooked vegetarian meal will be made from surplus food that would have otherwise been wasted, until it was rescued by Foodcloud. They connect the surplus food with charities and help support 3,600 social and community partnerships. The meal will be served at 7pm. Then sit back and digest while you watch 'Just Eat It'.

### 8pm to 9.30pm Just Eat It Movie Screening

Join us for a free screening of 'Just Eat It'. We all love food. As a society, we devour countless cooking shows, culinary magazines and foodie blogs. So how could we possibly be throwing nearly 50% of it in the trash?
Filmmakers and food lovers Jen and Grant dive into the issue of waste from farm, through retail, all the way to the back of their own fridge. After catching a glimpse of the billions of dollars of good food that is tossed each year in North America, they pledge to quit grocery shopping cold turkey and survive only on foods that would otherwise be thrown away.

The Rediscovery Centre supports the development of the circular economy and advocates for a more resilient, equitable society.

The Centre has four reuse social enterprises Rediscover Furniture, Rediscover Fashion, Rediscover Paint and Rediscover Cycling. Theses enterprises use waste and unwanted materials as a resource and raw material for new product design.

The Rediscovery Centre is based in the newly repurposed Boiler House in Ballymun. The building has been developed as a prototype ‘3D textbook’ a relatively new concept in experiential learning and the first of its kind in Europe. The centre demonstrates best practice building design, construction and operation and defines the building and environs as an educational tool to inspire, inform and lead positive behavioural change with respect to resource management and efficiency and Carrie Ann Moran will tell us all about it.

### 19.00 - 19.45 Sharing, Swapping & Sustainability by The Nu Wardrobe

Nu. is a start-up and community that seeks to encourage people to make sustainable choices and provides alternatives to the fast-fashion. In September, The Nu. Wardrobe will be launched. This is an online clothes sharing platform that allows members to share and swap clothes rather than buy brand new. In this talk, Ali Kelly, Co-Founder of Nu., will be talking about Nu.'s journey so far, her tips for shopping sustainably and how the sharing and circular economy is the future of fashion.

Join us for a screening of this light-hearted movie and bring your own bottle to it! Celebrate the Zero Waste Week with us and get ready for the big day (Saturday, that is!)

The story of the movie follows Jeb Berrier, an average American guy who is admittedly not a "tree hugger," who makes a pledge to stop using plastic bags. His girlfriend, Anne, joins him in the challenge to decrease their use of plastic at home. This small action gets Jeb thinking about plastic - not just about plastic bags, but other kinds of plastic. "What is plastic made of? Is it recyclable? Does it decompose when it ends up in the landfill? Does plastic have negative health effects?" Jeb wants to learn more, so he embarks on a global tour to unravel the complexities of our plastic world.
