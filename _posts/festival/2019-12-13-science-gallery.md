"People who work in labs are using approximately 15 times more plastic than the average person in Ireland", says Dr. Una Fitzgerald, the Director of the [Galway Neuroscience Centre](https://galwayneuroscience.com/) and a funded investigator in [CÚRAM](http://www.curamdevices.ie/), the SFI Research Centre for Medical Devices based at NUI Galway, which is the first research lab in Europe to be awarded [Green Lab Certification](https://www.mygreenlab.org/green-lab-certification.html), the global standard for laboratory sustainability best practice. Una will share her story of achieving this certification as part of the [Galway Green Labs initiative](https://vimeo.com/375847945) and how a lab can lead the transitions to sustainable practises across the campus to address issues such as plastic waste, energy reduction, recycling, and water usage.

#### 16:00 -- 17:00 <br/> Refuse, Reduce, Resue: Zero Waste Living in Dublin (Panel Discussion)

Join us for our panel discussion on Zero Waste Living in Dublin. We will hear what saying "No!" to single-use items and unnecessary packaging means for several of our fellow Dubliners. We are happy to have the following Zero Wasters on stage for a moderated discussion, followed by an open Q&A.

**Naomi Sheridan**, the owner of Phibsborogh based health food store [Noms](https://www.noms.ie/) will share her experience of continously expanding the package-free options in her shop driven by customer demand.

**Ciarán Smith** who co-founded the first fully packaging free food stall in Ireland (Bring Your Own) will talk about how it felt to pioneer Zero Waste living in uncharted terretory.

**Zdenka Thunder** of [Coming To Zero](https://comingtozero.com/) is a Dublin-based Zero Waste activist and blogger who is fighting food waste one jar at a time.

**Elaine Butler** of [Living Lightly in Ireland](https://livinglightlyinireland.wordpress.com/) is a sustainable living writer and speaker based in Dublin. She cuts through all the greenwashing out there to deliver simple, practical advice for anyone wanting to live more sustainably. She has been featured on the Irish TV programme Nationwide and in The Irish Times and The Irish Independent newspapers, appeared on the Claire Byrne Live Show on RTE and spoke on radio stations about living with less plastic. She has also given talks at the Airfield Food Festival, The Love your Home Show exhibit and Bloom in the Park.

#### 14:00 -- 14:45 <br/> Precious Plastic?! – Facts and figures on global plastic abundance and what we can do about it *with Celia Somlai*


Have you ever wondered how much plastic has been generated in total on this planet? And how much of that plastic actually has been recycled? Which industry produces the largest amount of plastic annually? Or which polymer is the most commonly used worldwide? Come to this informative talk to learn not only about the latest facts and figures, but also about practical solutions to this global challenge. Celia will also introduce you to the [Precious Plastic universe](https://preciousplastic.com/universe/how-does-it-work.html), an alternative, grass roots, plastic recycling community.

Celia Somlai is an environmental activist and researcher who is trying to live a low impact lifestyle. She has been deeply involved with the Zero Waste movement in Dublin for the last couple of years. She is the co-founder of [Precious Plastic Dublin](https://www.preciousplasticdublin.org/), a volunteer collective working on practical solutions to plastic waste in Dublin. Her personal interest and concern about the global plastic overconsumption led to her current academic [research on Irish and European packaging waste statistics at UCD](https://rewrapped.ucd.ie/).
