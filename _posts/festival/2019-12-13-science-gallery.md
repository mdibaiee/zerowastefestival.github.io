We are happy to announce that our next Zero Waste Festival will be held at the Science Gallery Dublin from January 25 to 26, 2020, as part of their ongoing PLASTIC exhibition. Come and join us as we learn how to vastly reduce our waste output, and make simple replacements with products that have little or no waste.

Zero Waste is all about getting as close to 'zero' as we can, in terms of the waste we produce as businesses, individuals and institutions.  This Zero Waste Festival will feature some of the best Zero Waste leaders in Ireland giving talks and workshops on how to cut the waste out of your household while keeping those purse strings tight!

The PLASTIC exhibition in the Science Gallery hosts a huge variety of engaging exhibits suitable for all ages that deal with the one material we can’t live  with but also not without. Plastic has great power, and with great power comes great responsibility. It has changed our daily lives and our environment more than any other material. The unsustainability of our relationship with plastic is well documented, but to stop using plastic entirely is not an option. 

But we can try to refuse single-use items, reduce what we consume and truly recycle valuable materials. Learn more about each of these steps during the Festival. We are currently working on finalising our schedule, so be sure to follow our social media and check back here for more updates to come.

The Science Gallery will be open from 12 pm (noon) to 6 pm on both days. The Zero Waste market and swap shops will close at 5 pm, so come early to avoid disappointment.

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/talks/saturday" %}

<a name="brian"></a>

#### 13:00 -- 13:45 <br/> Waste not want not: The danger and value of our bin content *with Brian Kelleher*

![Brian Kelleher](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/brian-kelleher.jpg "Brian Kelleher"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

Brian Kelleher is an environmental chemistry lecturer in the [School of Chemical Science, Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/chemistry/people/brian-kelleher.shtml). Much of his research involves the investigation of carbon and its transformation from one medium to the next, be it during the search for extra-terrestrial life or the recycling of waste. Brian will talk about opportunities and challenges for high value solutions for municipal residual waste. Although Ireland is set to meet the 2020 European target on the decrease of municipal solid waste in landfill, the targets outlined for 2030 will require an increased diversion of waste from landfill. At present, bio-stabilised residual waste is treated as waste and only approved for disposal in landfills or by incineration, which is not sustainable and contributes towards landfill capacity. There is strong evidence that compost from such waste can enhance soil nutritional status and crop productivity. A diverse range of technologies are available to convert municipal solid waste into biofuels and/or energy outputs. And Brian will talk about some of these.



<a name="una"></a>

#### 14:00 -- 14:45 <br/> Zero lab waste – pipe-dream or possible? *with Una Fitzgerald*

![Una Fitzgerald](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/una-fitzgerald.jpg "Una Fitzgerald"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

"People who work in labs are using approximately 15 times more plastic than the average person in Ireland", says Dr. Una Fitzgerald, the Director of the [Galway Neuroscience Centre](https://galwayneuroscience.com/) and a funded investigator in [CÚRAM](http://www.curamdevices.ie/), the SFI Research Centre for Medical Devices based at NUI Galway, which is the first research lab in Europe to be awarded [Green Lab Certification](https://www.mygreenlab.org/green-lab-certification.html), the global standard for laboratory sustainability best practice. Una will share her story of achieving this certification as part of the [Galway Green Labs initiative](https://vimeo.com/375847945) and how a lab can lead the transitions to sustainable practises across the campus to address issues such as plastic waste, energy reduction, recycling, and water usage.


<a name="michele"></a>

#### 15:00 -- 15:45 <br/> The World of Waste - how to get to Zero *with Michele Hallahan*

![Michele Hallahan](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/michele-hallahan.jpg "Michele Hallahan"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

Michele Hallahan has worked in the fields of ecological design, environmental management and sustainability consulting for over twenty years. Starting with a global overview of sustainability in general, and some juicy waste statistics, she will explain the key confusing definitions and obstacles that trip us up when doing our best to recycle/reduce waste.  What does 'biodegradable' mean? Is 'compostable' the same as 'recyclable' (answer: NO!), and what do the symbols on our packaging mean? How do you get on the Zero Waste journey? Being the [Sustainability Advisor to the Office of the Provost](https://www.tcd.ie/provost/sustainability/) at Trinity College Dublin, Michele will answer all your questions about waste.


<a name="panel"></a>

#### 16:00 -- 17:00 <br/> Refuse, Reduce, Reuse: Zero Waste Living in Dublin (Panel Discussion)

Join us for our panel discussion on Zero Waste Living in Dublin. We will hear what saying "No!" to single-use items and unnecessary packaging means for several of our fellow Dubliners. We are happy to have the following Zero Wasters on stage for a moderated discussion, followed by an open Q&A.

![Naomi Sheridan](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/naomi-sheridan.jpg "Naomi Sheridan"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

**Naomi Sheridan**, opened [Noms](https://www.noms.ie/) just over 14 months ago, in the hope of offering a unique shopping experience to the local northside community of Phibsborough. The shop has seen steady growth over the last few months, as more and more shoppers look to make more sustainable and ethical shopping decisions. Noms stands for Natural, Organic, Mindful and Sustainable, the four pillars which Noms is built on. As climate change and plastic pollution take centre stage, Noms offers customers the opportunity to stock up their pantry without the use of any plastic packaging. 
Naomi has spent most of her pre-noms career working in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry with major multinationals such as Mars Petcare, Heineken and General Mills, but decided after having her daughter, it was time to make a change, and look to follow a more holistic lifestyle.

**Zdenka Thunder** is a zero-waste advocate who lives in Dublin and shares her tips and tricks for 
living a more sustainable life on her platform, [Coming To Zero](https://comingtozero.com/).  If she’s not working or training on her circus skills, you’ll most likely find her in the garden trying to coax vegetables out of the ground or in the kitchen/laboratory where she passionately fills glass jars with everything and anything that couldn’t be allowed to go to waste, after all, she is a certified EPA’s Stop Food Waste trainer. Zdenka also helps to organise the Zero Waste Festival and gives the occasional workshop on practical ways to give our planet the helping hand it needs.

![Elaine Butler](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/elaine-butler.jpg "Elaine Butler"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

**Elaine Butler** of [Living Lightly in Ireland](https://livinglightlyinireland.wordpress.com/) is a sustainable living writer and speaker based in Dublin.

She has been featured on the Irish TV programme Nationwide and in The Irish Times and The Irish Independent newspapers, appeared on the Claire Byrne Live Show on RTE and spoke on radio stations about living with less plastic. She has also given talks at the Airfield Food Festival, The Love your Home Show exhibit and Bloom in the Park. 

![Ciarán Smyth](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/ciaran-smyth.jpg "Ciarán Smyth"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

**Ciarán Smyth** background is in science research, and he has been working on minimising waste and consumption since 2016. In early 2017, he and his wife Íde set up the Bring Your Own market stall to provide zero-waste shopping in Dublin and the surrounding area. At the end of 2018 he teamed up with the health and wholefoods store [Noms](https://www.noms.ie/) in Phibsborough to help with the package-free ethos of the store. He is particularly interested in minimising food waste, and trying to source as locally as possible.

An introduction to Zero Waste. Íde will guide you through the 5R’s, giving tips on easy wins and long term goals. She’ll talk about how to keep motivated and the unexpected benefits! 

[Íde](/team) is 4 years into her zero waste journey, which began with the idea of a “buy nothing new” year to address her consumption and quickly escalated from there. An avid traveller, she questions what we consider “normal” and takes inspiration from aspects of sustainability from around the world. She believes that our individual actions will help shape future policy, that you can make any change if you really want to, and that every small change is victory... many of which she documents on [Instagram as Itseasyifyouwantto](https://www.instagram.com/itseasyifyouwantto/)



<a name="celia"></a>

#### 14:00 -- 14:45 <br/> Precious Plastic?! – Facts and figures on global plastic abundance and what we can do about it *with Celia Somlai*

[Emmanuel Reynaud](https://twitter.com/ReynaudEmmanuel) who is a polymath with a need to build in a frugal manner. Raised in a remote farmland where everything must be used and preserved, he got involved in construction, electronics, optics gardening, cooking and so on. Emmanuel is a lecturer in UCD but develops open source easy to build microscopes and other scientific tools as well as provides support for major companies. Recently, he took on the challenge to reuse plastic items from our green bin to make everyday useful objects to demonstrate our wasteful ways and poor recycling policies.

Learn how to upcycle PET bottles into new, exciting things. This workshop will present a modular approach to PET bottle recycling that allow people to build not only animals (jellyfish, octopi, sea gooseberries) but also more advanced structures such as geodesic domes and other 3D  geometrical shapes for design and education. People are welcome to bring their own bottles (preferentially 1.5l ones without corrugation). The workshop will also explain briefly how bottles are currently recycled and the issue with the refund scheme.

#### 13:00 to 16:00 <br/> Beeswax Wrap Making

What is completely compostable, washable and can be rewaxed if needed to top your bottle of wine, carry home your bread or can even be used as a biodegradable straw? Beeswax wrap is a sustainable alternative to plastic wrap and other single-use plastics. Traditional plastic wrap is very difficult to recycle and most often ends up in landfill or in the ocean where it will possibly leach chemicals and take decades to degrade. 

In this workshop, [Science Gallery Dublin](https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/) will provide the materials and direction you need to infuse cotton with food-grade beeswax perfect to pack a lunch, wrap your shampoo bar or bundle a bouquet. Wax wraps have so many uses and can easily be folded into makeshift bowls, water vessels and many other objects with some simple folding skills. We are reusing old cotton t-shirts for this workshop as one t-shirt takes 2,700 litres of water to make, which equates to drinking water for one person for two years!

## Swap Shop

There will be a Clothes Swap Shop in the gallery space just above the Cafe. So, please bring your pre-loved items along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FZeroWasteFestivalIreland%2Fposts%2F1326153780889646&width=500" width="500" height="581" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. 

The Swap Shop will be open at 12 noon and continue until 5 pm. 

Also, don't worry if you run out of tokens but still find this nice pre-loved piece that would perfectly fit your wardrobe, we will have a donation box at the check-out where you can drop a coin or two to help us keep this a free event in the future.

All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity at the end of the day.
