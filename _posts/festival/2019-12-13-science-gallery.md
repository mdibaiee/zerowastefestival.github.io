We are happy to announce that our next Zero Waste Festival will be held at the Science Gallery Dublin from January 25 to 26, 2020, as part of their ongoing PLASTIC exhibition. Come and join us as we learn how to vastly reduce our waste output, and make simple replacements with products that have little or no waste.

Zero Waste is all about getting as close to 'zero' as we can, in terms of the waste we produce as businesses, individuals and institutions.  This Zero Waste Festival will feature some of the best Zero Waste leaders in Ireland giving talks and workshops on how to cut the waste out of your household while keeping those purse strings tight!
 
The PLASTIC exhibition in the Science Gallery hosts a huge variety of engaging exhibits suitable for all ages that deal with the one material we can’t live  with but also not without. Plastic has great power, and with great power comes great responsibility. It has changed our daily lives and our environment more than any other material. The unsustainability of our relationship with plastic is well documented, but to stop using plastic entirely is not an option. 

But we can try to refuse single-use items, reduce what we consume and truly recycle valuable materials. Learn more about each of these steps during the Festival. We are currently working on finalising our schedule, so be sure to follow our social media and check back here for more updates to come.

The Science Gallery will be open from 12 pm (noon) to 6 pm on both days. The Zero Waste market and swap shops will close at 5 pm, so come early to avoid disappointment.

### How to get there?

The Science Gallery is located right in the heart of Dublin, at the north-east end of Trinity College. You can plan your trip to the Science Gallery with public transport (Bus and LUAS) by using the [Transport for Ireland Journey Planner](http://www.journeyplanner.transportforireland.ie/).

The Trinity LUAS stop on the Green line is just 500 m away and all buses going along Pearse Street bring you close enough to the Science Gallery. 

There are bicycle racks on campus and plenty of [Dublin Bike stations](http://www.dublinbikes.ie/All-Stations/Station-map) in the area, including one just right in front of the Science Gallery.

"People who work in labs are using approximately 15 times more plastic than the average person in Ireland", says Dr. Una Fitzgerald, the Director of the [Galway Neuroscience Centre](https://galwayneuroscience.com/) and a funded investigator in [CÚRAM](http://www.curamdevices.ie/), the SFI Research Centre for Medical Devices based at NUI Galway, which is the first research lab in Europe to be awarded [Green Lab Certification](https://www.mygreenlab.org/green-lab-certification.html), the global standard for laboratory sustainability best practice. Una will share her story of achieving this certification as part of the [Galway Green Labs initiative](https://vimeo.com/375847945) and how a lab can lead the transitions to sustainable practises across the campus to address issues such as plastic waste, energy reduction, recycling, and water usage.

##### 16:00 -- 17:00 <br/> Refuse, Reduce, Reuse: Zero Waste Living in Dublin (Panel Discussion)

Join us for our panel discussion on Zero Waste Living in Dublin. We will hear what saying "No!" to single-use items and unnecessary packaging means for several of our fellow Dubliners. We are happy to have the following Zero Wasters on stage for a moderated discussion, followed by an open Q&A.

**Naomi Sheridan**, the owner of Phibsborogh based health food store [Noms](https://www.noms.ie/) will share her experience of continously expanding the package-free options in her shop driven by customer demand.

**Ciarán Smith** who co-founded the first fully packaging free food stall in Ireland (Bring Your Own) will talk about how it felt to pioneer Zero Waste living in uncharted territory.

**Zdenka Thunder** of [Coming To Zero](https://comingtozero.com/) is a Dublin-based Zero Waste activist and blogger who is fighting food waste one jar at a time.

**Elaine Butler** of [Living Lightly in Ireland](https://livinglightlyinireland.wordpress.com/) is a sustainable living writer and speaker based in Dublin. She cuts through all the greenwashing out there to deliver simple, practical advice for anyone wanting to live more sustainably. She has been featured on the Irish TV programme Nationwide and in The Irish Times and The Irish Independent newspapers, appeared on the Claire Byrne Live Show on RTE and spoke on radio stations about living with less plastic. She has also given talks at the Airfield Food Festival, The Love your Home Show exhibit and Bloom in the Park.

<a name="celia"></a>

##### 14:00 -- 14:45 <br/> Precious Plastic?! – Facts and figures on global plastic abundance and what we can do about it *with Celia Somlai*


Have you ever wondered how much plastic has been generated in total on this planet? And how much of that plastic actually has been recycled? Which industry produces the largest amount of plastic annually? Or which polymer is the most commonly used worldwide? Come to this informative talk to learn not only about the latest facts and figures, but also about practical solutions to this global challenge. Celia will also introduce you to the [Precious Plastic universe](https://preciousplastic.com/universe/how-does-it-work.html), an alternative, grass roots, plastic recycling community.

![Celia Somlai](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/celia-somlai.jpg "Celia Somlai"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

Celia Somlai is an environmental activist and researcher who is trying to live a low impact lifestyle. She has been deeply involved with the Zero Waste movement in Dublin for the last couple of years. She is the co-founder of [Precious Plastic Dublin](https://www.preciousplasticdublin.org/), a volunteer collective working on practical solutions to plastic waste in Dublin. Her personal interest and concern about the global plastic overconsumption led to her current academic [research on Irish and European packaging waste statistics at UCD](https://rewrapped.ucd.ie/). You can follow her Zero Waste adventures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowaste.adventures/) and her [blog](https://www.celiasomlai.com).

### Zero Waste Market

Want to get your Zero Waste shopping shorted? Come check our market. We will be updating our list of vendors in the next few days.


### Info Stands

As always we invite a good few great local initiatives and community groups to present their work at our Festival. So, keep checking back for more info in the next few days. 


### Workshops

We will offer exciting workshops on making your own beeswax wrapping paper, sanitary pads and bioplastic. More details are coming soon.


### Swap Shop

There will be a Clothes Swap Shop in the gallery space just above the Cafe. So, please bring your pre-loved items along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FZeroWasteFestivalIreland%2Fposts%2F1326153780889646&width=500" width="500" height="581" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. 

The Swap Shop will be open at 12 noon and continue until 5 pm. 

Also, don't worry if you run out of tokens but still find this nice pre-loved piece that would perfectly fit your wardrobe, we will have a donation box at the check-out where you can drop a coin or two to help us keep this a free event in the future.

All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity at the end of the day.








## What to bring?

### For notes

There'll be no leaflets or business cards, so bring your phone, a camera or a pen and paper.

### For workshops and the market

You'll need a fork or spoon for samples of food.

### For shopping

You'll need your own containers for loose goods and refills and bring some bags to carry your purchases home.
