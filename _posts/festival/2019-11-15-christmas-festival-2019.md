The Zero Waste Christmas Festival is back! Join us and all the merriment at The George, D02, on Sunday 1st of December from 12 noon.


<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FZeroWasteFestivalIreland%2Fposts%2F1282849595220065&width=500" width="500" height="614" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

Christmas can be a difficult time to keep your bins empty and your recycling pile small, but during this event you will get tips on cutting down on waste from food and packaging, gifts and wrapping to decorations and festive dressing!

From making better choices of materials, reusing and upcycling, there will be something to be learned for everyone, no matter where you are on your journey. For your first foray into zero waste, stop by our info-stand for guidance on beginning your zero waste lifestyle and learn about simple changes you can do in your daily life, be it in the bathroom, kitchen or on the go. The workshops, talks and demos this Christmas will include advice on alternative gifting and gift wrapping, edible gifts, festive food and drinks, creating upcycled gifts and buying items that last. These workshops and talks will operate on a first-come first-served basis. 

Our market stalls will offer you alternatives to plastic-laden gifts promoting handmade, sustainable and conscious gifts. We will focus on handmade, natural, package-free, locally made and second-hand products to help you with your Christmas shopping - but you will also be able to stock up on your loose food items or refills of cleaning products. 

The ever popular clothes swap will be back too with the festive addition of Christmas jumpers! So bring your old one and swap it for a new loved one.

### Swap Shops

There will be a clothes and Christmas jumper swap shops at this Christmas Edition of the Zero Waste Festival. So, please bring your pre-loved items along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FZeroWasteFestivalIreland%2Fposts%2F1295847140586977&width=500" width="500" height="557" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. 

Drop-off for the Swap Shop will open at 12 noon and continue until 4 pm. The Swap Shop will be open for swapping from 1 pm to 5:30 pm. 

Also, don't worry if you run out of tokens but still find this nice pre-loved piece that would perfectly fit your wardrobe, we will have a donation box at the check-out where you can drop a coin or two to help us keep this a free event in the future.

All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.
