Christmas can be a difficult time to keep your bins empty and your recycling pile small, but during this event you will get tips on cutting down on waste from food and packaging, gifts and wrapping to decorations and festive dressing!

From making better choices of materials, reusing and upcycling, there will be something to be learned for everyone, no matter where you are on your journey. For your first foray into zero waste, stop by our info-stand for guidance on beginning your zero waste lifestyle and learn about simple changes you can do in your daily life, be it in the bathroom, kitchen or on the go. The workshops, talks and demos this Christmas will include advice on alternative gifting and gift wrapping, edible gifts, festive food and drinks, creating upcycled gifts and buying items that last. These workshops and talks will operate on a first-come first-served basis. 

Our market stalls will offer you alternatives to plastic-laden gifts promoting handmade, sustainable and conscious gifts. We will focus on handmade, natural, package-free, locally made and second-hand products to help you with your Christmas shopping - but you will also be able to stock up on your loose food items or refills of cleaning products. 

The ever popular clothes swap will be back too with the festive addition of Christmas jumpers! So bring your old one and swap it for a new loved one.  


## Venue

The festival will be hosted at the [The George Bar](http://thegeorge.ie/) at [89 South Great George's Street](https://goo.gl/maps/VmcQiFwirShH7JrC7), Dublin 2, from 12 noon to 6 pm on Sunday, December 1st, 2019.

The George is one of Dublin's most iconic LGBT+ venues and features a wide variety of LGBT+ artwork. Please consider this when visiting with children.

The venue is wheelchair/buggy accessible on the ground floor, however, this unfortunately excludes the workshops/talks and some vendors/info-stands which are located on the gallery.

### Swap Shops

There will be a clothes and Christmas jumper swap shops at this Christmas Edition of the Zero Waste Festival. So, please bring your pre-loved items along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. 

Also, don't worry if you run out of tokens but still find this nice pre-loved piece that would perfectly fit your wardrobe, we will have a donation box at the check-out where you can drop a coin or two to help us keep this a free event in the future.

All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.


## What to bring

### For notes

There'll be no leaflets or business cards, so bring your phone, a camera or a pen and paper.

### For workshops

You'll need a fork or spoon for samples of food.

### For shopping

You'll need your own containers for loose goods and refills and bring some bags to carry your purchases home.

### For food and drinks

Bring your own mug, water bottle and lunch box and utensils. You're also welcome to bring a picnic to share with your new Zero Waste friends.

### Stuff to swap/share/donate

- Clean and wearable men's, women's and kid's clothes for the swap shop
- Spare jars can be useful for other people who didn't bring enough
- Bring any take-away containers you have built up to share in case people are short
