### Swap Shops

There will be three swaps hops at this Christmas Edition of the Zero Waste Festival, back by popular demand. So, please bring your pre-loved items along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

#### Pre-loved Clothes Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.


## Venue

The Festival is going a little greener this year and encourages you to use public transport to get to Airfield Estate! Festival entry is FREE for those travelling by foot, public transport and by bicycle. There's limited parking for €5 per car in Airfield Estate on a first come, first served basis.
