|:-----------|:--------------------------------|:------

| 12:00 noon |  Clean Green Wardrobe           | Íde Mhic Gabhann of Bring Your Own

|  3:00 pm   |  Decluttering/Minimalism        | Laura Cahill


##### 11:00 am - Cleaning chemistry simplified with Tita

Cleaning, like anything, is not chemical free. But not all cleaning chemicals are equal. You will learn about debunking cleaning product labels and how you can reduce waste in relation to home cleaning. There will also be a conversation of what is currently realistic and will make a difference. This talk will be led by Titta Jones, co-founder and CEO of Lilly's Eco Clean, an Irish producer of natural cleaning chemicals. This small company has a big dream about making a difference in both the cleaning chemicals used in daily lives as well as how to do it best by least amount of waste.


##### 12:00 noon - Clean Green Wardrobe with Íde

We explore the idea of starting with the wardrobe you have and moving towards a collection that will be lighter on the planet, as well as freeing up time and space in your home, luggage and mind. Íde loves shopping and clothes, but also travelling and using everything she has. In the last two years she has been able to consolidate these interests as she strives for the perfect capsule without harming the environment on the way.


##### 1:00 pm - Spring Cleaning Your Cleaning with Molly

Cleaning can be a dirty business. Whether you are worried about the environment or your health, this workshop will show you how to switch to less wasteful alternatives. Going room by room, learn what changes you can make from simple product swaps, zero waste tools, or completely natural alternatives. If how to get the most from baking soda and vinegar has you a little stumped or if you just want to learn a little more come along for demonstrations and recipes! 


##### 2:00 pm - Healthy Eating with Zero Waste with Zdenka

A welcome side effect of living towards producing minimal waste is that you end up eating healthier - mainly because you cut processed, lazy pre-packaged food. So if you want to start eating better this spring, Zdenka will show you how to choose (and make) healthy and package-free alternatives, while making your gut happy and minimising food waste in the process.


##### 3:00 pm - Decluttering/Minimalism with Laura

The last talk of the day will be a conversation about the concept of enough, how having less can have a positive effect on mental health and what the true meaning of minimalism is. You can also get practical ideas on how to declutter! The conversation will be led by Laura Cahill, who is a minimalist and aims to create simplicity in her life to be able to have more time, energy, and money for her family, career, and her passion to travel.
