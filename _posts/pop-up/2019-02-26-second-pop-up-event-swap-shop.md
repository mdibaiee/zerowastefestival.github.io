The team of the Zero Waste Festival Ireland is organising a new series of free, themed pop-up events. The second event of this series will be a clothes swap shop.

## What?

### Clothes Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the event. The swap shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the swap shop. There will be a donation box if you run out of tokens. All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop after the event.

## Where?

The event will take place at the [Third Space Cafe](http://thirdspace.ie/) in Smithfield, Dublin 7. Best to come by foot (if you live in the city centre) or by LUAS (Smithfield stop on the Red Line) or bus. You can plan your journey [here](https://journeyplanner.transportforireland.ie/nta/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en).

## More info!

Head over to the [Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/326153964696970/) to let us know if you can make it and get the latest updates.

The event is free but we will need to cover 30â‚¬ for renting the space. So, we welcome a small contribution towards that, if you can. You can also buy coffee from Third Space during the event.
