Want to get started with your Zero Waste lifestyle? Not sure where to find the best bang-for-the-buck without packaging? What are the smaller and larger Zero Waste hacks that help you in your daily routine as a student at Trinity?

## What?

As part of [TCD's Green Week 2020](https://www.tcd.ie/provost/sustainability/greenweek/), this pop-up event presented by Camilla and Celia is open to all: students, staff and the public. Come along to this informal lunch-time presentation and discussion on how to make (many) small steps towards a more sustainable Zero Waste /  low impact / conscious consuming lifestyle. Camilla Roselli and Celia Somlai from the Zero Waste Festival Ireland team will share plenty of their practical (and cost effective) tips with the focus on living in Dublin as a Trinity student. However, most of the tips will be also useful even if you are NOT a Trinity student! Academic and non-academic staff is welcome as well!

## Where?

You can find us in the Seminar Room on the top floor of [Simon Perry Building](https://goo.gl/maps/TcfDgzeqR2EmJN9P9), tucked in right in between the Rugby Pitch and the new Business School. There will be signs from the ground floor leading you to the room. 

Also, feel free to bring your lunch along (in your own reusable container, of course). We have a microwave there as well, so you can warm up your food. 

Best to come by foot (if you live in the area) or by LUAS and bus. You can plan your journey by using the [Transport For Ireland Journey Planner](https://journeyplanner.transportforireland.ie/nta/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en) our check out the map below.

## When?

Wednesday, February 19th, 2020 from 1:00 PM &#8211; 2:00 PM

This is a free event but donations to support the Zero Waste Festival are always welcome, so that we can buy our speakers a drink.

## Get involved

Last but not least: We are always on the look-out for new people to share their Zero Waste journey and inspire other people. We also want to hear from you if you would like us to cover a certain topic or a certain aspect of Zero Waste and low-impact living! Let us know if you have a great idea for a workshop we could host. Or maybe you own or know of a venue that could host a series of our pop-up events? Or maybe you would want to organise an event yourself outside of Dublin? Do not hesitate to get in contact with us by sending an email to [info@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:info@zerowastefestival.ie).
