The team of the Zero Waste Festival Ireland is organising a series of free, themed pop-up events. The theme of the next session is "Zero Waste For Beginners".

## What?

The third event of this series will go back to basics, Zero Waste for beginners (or where ever you are on your Zero Waste journey).

There will be three short presentations:

- What is Zero Waste and why we do it? with Elaine from [Living Lightly in Ireland](https://www.facebook.com/livinglightlyinireland/)
- Where to start? with Thais Aykroyd  
- Where to find local support? with Zdenka from [oming to Zero](https://www.facebook.com/comingtozero/)

After the presentations the floor will be opened for a Q&A.

## Where?

The event will take place at the [Third Space Cafe](http://thirdspace.ie/) in Smithfield, Dublin 7. Best to come by foot (if you live in the city centre) or by LUAS (Smithfield stop on the Red Line) or bus. You can plan your journey [here](https://journeyplanner.transportforireland.ie/nta/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en).
