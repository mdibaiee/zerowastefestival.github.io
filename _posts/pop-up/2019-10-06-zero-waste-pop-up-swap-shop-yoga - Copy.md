We will host a Zero Waste Talk on "Good Habits for Climate Change" with Celia and a clothes Swap Shop on October 12 at Dublin City Hot Yoga in D02.

## What?

### Zero Waste Talk

Yoga is not just about how you do your postures, yoga is about how you live your life. How aware are you of the environment that you live in? With all this talk of a climate crisis, it can be overwhelming to know what is best to do. Celia will be guest speaking as part of the zero waste pop up talks by the Zero Waste Festival Ireland team and will offer many ideas for living and gearing yourself towards a zero waste lifestyle. There will be plenty of time for questions. 

This is a donation based event, so please bring all your friends, whether they normally come to the studio or not. All the donation will go to the [GoFundMe campaign\(https://www.gofundme.com/f/precious-plastic-dublin-stage-1#) for [Precious Plastic Dublin\(https://www.preciousplasticdublin.org/). The more we can change our habits as a collective the better the result!

### Swap Shop

Following on from the talk we will have a clothes swap. The perfect way to start your zero waste journey! You can be sure that someone will enjoy the clothes you no longer do. We are asking for a â‚¬5 donation that will go directly towards funding a beehive. And we all know we need bees if we are going to continue to live on this planet (not the least for growing our cotton!). Please just show up, we would love to see you at this event!
