The team of the Zero Waste Festival Ireland is organising a series of free, themed pop-up events. The theme of the next session is "Make Your Own: Beauty Edition".

## What?

Have you thought about making your own beauty products but didn't know where to start? The last event from this first pop-up series will give you some helpful tips! We'll talk about homemade toothpaste, scrubs, soaps, lotions... all things beauty! There will be some demonstrations, so you can see how easy it really is :) 

## Where?

The event will take place at the [Third Space Cafe](http://thirdspace.ie/) in Smithfield, Dublin 7. Best to come by foot (if you live in the city centre) or by LUAS (Smithfield stop on the Red Line) or bus. You can plan your journey [here](https://journeyplanner.transportforireland.ie/nta/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en).

The event is free but we will need to cover 60â‚¬ for renting the space. So, we welcome a small contribution towards that, if you can. You can also buy coffee from Third Space during the event.
