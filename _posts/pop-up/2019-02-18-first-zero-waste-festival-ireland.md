The team of the Zero Waste Festival Ireland is organising a new series of free, themed pop-up events. The theme of the first session is "Grow Your Own" and we are teaming up with the [Dublin CSA](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/) (Community Supported Agriculture) for this event.

## What?

### Grow Your Own: Sharing experiences

We will have 4-5 short presentations from hobby gardeners sharing their experiences of growing their own food in a city garden/a small balcony/a farm in the suburbs/a shelf in the kitchen. So far we have confirmed Zdenka from [Coming to Zero](https://comingtozero.com/), Mies who runs regular [Wildflower Walks](https://www.facebook.com/WildflowerWalksIreland/), Celia from [Zero Waste Adventures](https://www.celiasomlai.com/) and Seamus, the [Dublin CSA's](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/) farmer.

### Grow Your Own: Seed Swap

Have some leftover seeds from last year? Want to share those amazing tomatoes you grew? The chilly peppers turned out to be too spicy for your family? Bring along some seeds to swap with your fellow gardening enthusiasts and share tips and tricks about what makes them grow best. 

## Where?

The event will take place at the [Third Space Cafe](http://thirdspace.ie/) in Smithfield, Dublin 7. Best to come by foot (if you live in the city centre) or by LUAS (Smithfield stop on the Red Line) or bus. You can plan your journey [here](https://journeyplanner.transportforireland.ie/nta/XSLT_TRIP_REQUEST2?language=en).
