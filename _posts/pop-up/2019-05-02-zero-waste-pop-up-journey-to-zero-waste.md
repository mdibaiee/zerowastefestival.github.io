We are back with our series of free, themed pop-up events, this time hosted by MVP in Dublin 8. The theme of the next session is "Journey to Zero Waste".

## What?

Our series of pop-up events aims to bring together like-minded people on their journey towards Zero Waste in an inclusive, open and inspiring atmosphere. 
We are hosting this series of evening events across various venues in Dublin trying to cover a wide range of workshops, swap shops, talks, discussions, and Zero Waste basics for people interested in Zero Waste and low-impact living in Dublin and Ireland.

For this event, we invited a handful of local Dublin Zero Wasters to share their stories about how they started on their journey and what inspired them along the way.
There will also be a short introduction to the principles of Zero Waste living and how to go about it in Dublin. So, come along and get inspired to start your own journey towards Zero. It is really not that hard at all and if you're not sure where to start, we got you covered. Even if you're already far along the way, drop by and share your own experiences with the community.

The event is free and you can order drinks from the [MVP bar](http://mvpdublin.com/) downstairs during the event if you like!



## Where?

The event will take place at the [MVP bar](http://mvpdublin.com/) (upstairs) in 29 Upper Clanbrassil St., Dublin 8. Best to come by foot (if you live in the city centre) or by LUAS (Charlemont stop on the Green Line) or bus (stops 1290 and 1347 on Clanbrassil St. are served by bus routes 9, 16, 49 and 54a).
