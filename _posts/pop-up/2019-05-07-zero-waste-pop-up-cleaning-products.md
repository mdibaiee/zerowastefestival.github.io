Homemade cleaning products are natural, green and eco-friendly. We show you how to make them at our free, themed pop-up events hosted by MVP in Dublin 8

## What?

Want to have a zero waste household?

In this event, we will tell you everything you need to start and continue with your journey towards zero from your soap to your laundry products!

On the 21st of May, join us upstairs at the MVP for a series of talks and workshops where you will get to know all the tips and techniques to turn your kitchen and your bathroom into a zero waste paradise!

The event is free and you can order drinks from the [MVP bar](http://mvpdublin.com/) downstairs during the event if you like!



## Where?

The event will take place at the [MVP bar](http://mvpdublin.com/) (upstairs) in 29 Upper Clanbrassil St., Dublin 8. Best to come by foot (if you live in the city centre) or by LUAS (Charlemont stop on the Green Line) or bus (stops 1290 and 1347 on Clanbrassil St. are served by bus routes 9, 16, 49 and 54a).

Whatever we collect will help us to express our gratitude (in form of a Zero Waste shop voucher) towards all our speakers without whom this event wouldn't be possible.



## Get involved

Last but not least: We are always on the look-out for new people to share their Zero Waste journey and inspire other people. We also want to hear from you if you would like us to cover a certain topic or a certain aspect of Zero Waste and low-impact living! Let us know if you have a great idea for a workshop we could host. Or maybe you own or know of a venue that could host a series of our pop-up events? Or maybe you would want to organise an event yourself outside of Dublin? Do not hesitate to get in contact with us by sending an email to [info@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:info@zerowastefestival.ie).
