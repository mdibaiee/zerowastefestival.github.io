Zero Waste Week 2018 is coming to Dublin from Monday the 3rd of September until Sunday the 9th. We have a great line-up of events for you to attend during the week. 

This year, we have teamed up with great eco-conscious stores, venues and events to bring you the flavour of zero waste throughout the week. 

Check out the full schedule on our [Facebook event page](https://www.facebook.com/pg/ZeroWasteFestivalIreland/events/){:target="_blank"}.
