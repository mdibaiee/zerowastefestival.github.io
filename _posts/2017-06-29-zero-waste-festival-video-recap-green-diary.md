Thanks to The Green Diary for stopping by at our Zero Waste Festival last weekend and compiling a nice little video of the event.

The first Zero Waste Festival in Ireland took place last Sunday in Dublin. We are very excited that [The Green Diary](http://www.thegreendiary.com/){:target="_blank"} took their time and compiled this little recap of our festival. The Green Diary is a blog run by Jenn, Alex and Niall devoted to the interconnectedness between our health, the environment and society, and highlights their passion about living an eco-holistic and sustainable lifestyle. Check them out, if you haven't yet!

In the video, you will meet some vendors such as Paedar Rice from [Smallchanges](https://www.facebook.com/smallchangesshop/){:target="_blank"} talking about how they help their customers to reduce unecessary plastic packaging. Gabrielle Lafitte from the [Dublin Food Co-op](https://www.dublinfood.coop/){:target="_blank"} explains how they aim to bring the choice back to the people on whether to buy something packaged or loose while Ciar√°n Smyth of [Bring Your Own](https://www.facebook.com/bringyourowncontainers/){:target="_blank"} runs you through how customers can reduce their environmental impact by bringing their own containers like lunch boxes, jars, and cotton bags to their stall. At then end, Belle McCabe of [OtherMother Creations](https://www.facebook.com/OtherMotherCreations/){:target="_blank"} talks about her Zero Waste journey when it comes to rediscovering cloth nappies instead of defaulting to the ubiquitous single-use nappies.
