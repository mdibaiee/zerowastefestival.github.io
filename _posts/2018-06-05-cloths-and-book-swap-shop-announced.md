We will host several Swap Shops during the Festival. Please bring your pre-loved item along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

### Pre-loved Cloths Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. As all unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day, there will be a "pick-whatever-you-want" *Happy Hour from 4 pm on* -- so, no tokens needed after 4 pm to pick up any of the remaining items.

### Book Swap Shop

There will be a dedicated Book Swap table at the Festival. Bring your old favourites and the books you bought but never read and exchange them for some exciting new books you will never read (well, we hope you will read them -- otherwise, check out these [7 Other Uses For Books Besides Reading Them](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/7-other-uses-for-books-besides-reading-them/){:target="_blank"}). As with the Cloths Swap Shop above, we will operate on "item-per-item" basis with a *Happy Hour after 4 pm*. Unclaimed books will be donated to the annual [TCD Secondhand Booksale](https://www.tcd.ie/booksale/){:target="_blank"}.
