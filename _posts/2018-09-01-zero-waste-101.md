Would you like to embark on your zero waste journey but don't know where to start? Recyclable or not, biodegradable, compostable, do you find it confusing and overwhelming? On the first day of the Zero Waste Week, Monday the 3rd of September- a dedicated to the first 'R' - Refuse - we are here to help you. The event 'Zero Waste 101' will take place in [Smallchanges](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Smallchanges+Wholefoods+Store/@53.363428,-6.2604867,17z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x4867e64e2b1fadd5:0xc357e6bc91436221!2sSmallchanges+Wholefoods+Store!8m2!3d53.363428!4d-6.258298!3m4!1s0x4867e64e2b1fadd5:0xc357e6bc91436221!8m2!3d53.363428!4d-6.258298){:target="_blank"} in Drumcondra, Dublin 19 at 7.30pm.

Timi from [Simple No Waste Life] (https://simplenowastelife.com){:target="_blank"} will guide you through the 5R's of zero waste and give you tips on easy wins and longterm goals - and you can choose what works for you. Timi, mum of 2, will give no-nonsense, hands-on advice on how to ditch disposables, choose reusables and make conscious choices overall for you and your family. 

The event will take place in Smallchanges shop in ABC Drumcondra from 7.30pm. But why not pop in before the event and stock up on unpackaged fruit and veg, loose dry food, refill your olive oil, vinegar or cleaning products? You can find a wide selection of local and ethical products in this eco-store in Dublin 9. 

Update: After last year's very popular event we limited the number of tickets and this event is now sold out but you can still drop before or after the event to chat to fellow zero wasters!
