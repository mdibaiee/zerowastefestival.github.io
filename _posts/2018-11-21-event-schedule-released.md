We are proud to release the complete Event Schedule for our upcoming [Zero Waste Christmas Festival](/2018-12-festival) on Sunday, December 2, at The Green Door Market in Bluebell, Dublin. This time, we will bring you our usual mix of a Zero Waste market with many interesting vendors selling loose goods and Zero Waste essentials, info stands from local initiatives and organisations helping us to become more aware and sustainable consumers, a Make Space, Swap Shops, and a mix of interesting talks and workshops.

Admission to the main festival is free. However, we charge a fee for the workshops/talks in Room 1 and 2. You can sign up and get your passes in our [tickets](/tickets) section. A separate ticket will be required for each child for the Planting Trees with Santa workshop to help us cover Santa's milk and cookies.

Check out the [Event section](2018-12-festical) for more info on all the events and the Festival in general.

We all are looking forward to seeing you in December!
