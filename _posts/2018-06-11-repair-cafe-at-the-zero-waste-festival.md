Together with [VOICE Ireland](https://voiceireland.org/){:target="blank"} we will set up a Repair Cafe during the festival where you can learn how to extend the life of your stuff through simple repairs. This is a community event where you can bring in broken items and see how to fix them alongside expert volunteers. Repairs include electrical/electronics, wooden & general repairs, jewellery, and sewing. The overall objective is to bring back a culture of repair and support local repair businesses. So bring in your broken items and learn how to fix them.
