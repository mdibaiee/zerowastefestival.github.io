If you haven't yet but you want to start your journey or find out ways to improve how you too can work towards zero waste, make sure to come along to the talk which will be held in-store on Friday September 7th from 6pm. Molly Aylesbury from [Bare Necessities Ireland](https://www.facebook.com/BareNecessitiesIreland/){:target="_blank"} will there to share her expertise on how you can reduce the amount of waste you produce in your daily life.

You can also stock up while you're there! They will have 20% off all dispensed products on the day - all organic and already a great price so make sure to bring your jars to fill up! 

Itâ€™s a journey that we all need to make so why not start yours now?
