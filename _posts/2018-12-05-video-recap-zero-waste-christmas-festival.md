Here are some impressions from our Zero Waste Christmas Festival at The Greendoor Market in Bluebell, Dublin. We brought you a day filled with great food on edible plates, inspiring conversations about [#breakingfreefromplastics](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/breakingfreefromplastic/) and [#zerowaste](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/zerowaste/), a wide range of Zero Waste and Christmas themed talks & workshops, a Make Space, more than 30 market and info stalls, and even Santa was there to plant small trees with the young ones. 

Thanks to all the people making this festival possible. 

The next Zero Waste Festival will take place in March 2019 in Carlow.
