Íde is a true sustainarian and founding mother of the Zero Waste Festival. Her journey towards living more sustainably started back in 2016, which she declared to be her personal buy-nothing-new-year. Ever since, she graduated to be a renown [Zero Waste lifestyle expert](https://www.tipperarystar.ie/news/home/307930/lifestyle-expert-to-visit-cashel.html){:target="_blank"} and also is the co-owner of [Bring Your Own](https://www.facebook.com/bringyourowncontainers/){:target="_blank"}, the first Zero Waste stall touring the markets of Dublin and its surroundings. However, Íde is most passionate about sustainable clothing and capsule wardrobes, which you will see when you check out her [blog](http://blogota.weebly.com/journey-to-a-sustainable-wardrobe){:target="_blank"}.
