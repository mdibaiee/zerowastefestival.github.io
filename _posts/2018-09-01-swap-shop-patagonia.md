Are you in a need of a wardrobe upgrade for the (almost here) autumn? 

In line with the Wednesday's topic for the Zero Waste Week 'REUSE', why don't you come and swap your unloved pieces for some exciting new ones from other swappers?! 

Hosted by our friends in the [Patagonia Outlet](http://eu.patagonia.com/ie/en/home/){:target="_blank"} the event will take place in their store on Exchequer Street in Dublin 2 between 6-8pm... pop in after work, have a look (and maybe even a drink) and meet like-minded fashionistas!

Bring any clothes in good condition (remember - you want them to get a new home!) and note that we will operate a piece-for-piece swap shop.
