Sindy is our voice on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ZeroWasteFest) and helps as on-the-spot volunteer at and in-between the festivals. Her two boys also frequently join in as our youngest Zero Waste Festival volunteers. She prefers living off-line so doesn't have any social media accounts to follow but you can chat with her about food waste, (beginner) GIY gardening, and household thriftiness.
