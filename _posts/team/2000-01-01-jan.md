Jan is an environmental scientist with an undeniable passion for sustainability, data, more data, and quirky facts. E.g., did you know that, according to the [Litter Monitoring System](http://litter.ie/system_survey_results/index.shtml), cigarette-related-litter constituted about 55% of all street litter in Ireland in 2016, while food-related-litter contributed 24%? Jan mainly takes care of our website and you might see him shoot a few videos and click a picture or two during our events. You can also find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JanKnappe) or check out his personal [blog](https://www.janknappe.com).
