Our next partner for the Zero Waste Week is the Green Door Market. They are an indoor food market located in Unit 1a Bluebell Business Park, Old Naas Road, Dublin 12. Their mission is to bring top quality food in an inviting space where customers can enjoy a convivial market experience and meet the people who produce their food. 

Tuesday's theme of the week is REDUCE and at the Green Door Market we will be focusing on how to cut down on waste in your kitchen from packaging waste to leftovers.

You will we able to stock up on package free, locally grown and organic fruit and veg from [Nurney Farm](https://www.organicveg.net/organic-farm-shop){:target="_blank"} and loose dry foods from [The Good Crop Company](https://www.facebook.com/thegoodcropco/){:target="_blank"} and [Bring Your Own](https://www.facebook.com/bringyourowncontainers/){:target="_blank"}. 

There will be an info stand to explain why and how to reduce waste.

At 4pm Molly from [Bare Necessities](https://www.facebook.com/BareNecessitiesIreland/){:target="_blank"} will show you how to reduce the amount of toiletries in your bathroom, get rid of all the plastic bottles and make some beauty products yourself...and all you need are a few pantry staples! 

At 5 pm an interactive talk including jar upcycling introduces the concept of reducing food packaging.

At 6 pm Zdenka from [Coming to Zero](https://comingtozero.com){:target="_blank"} will give you tips and tricks on how to reduce food waste, from sensible buying to using up leftovers.

Complimentary tea and coffee will be provided by the Green Door Market, to those who bring their own reusable cup.

The Green Door Market opens at 12 noon and the info stand will be set up all day, so pop in early if the evening doesn't suit.
