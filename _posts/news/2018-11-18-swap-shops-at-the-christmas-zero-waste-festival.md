We are excited to host several Swap Shops during the upcoming [Zero Waste Christmas Festival at The Green Door Market](/18-12-festival). Get ready for the party season with something new to you outfits (and maybe even get a few gifts)! Please bring your pre-loved items along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

## Pre-loved Clothes Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.

Quick rules:

- Bring your clean wearable ready to be loved by someone else, clothes, shoes and accessories.
- Exchange one-for-one with tokens.
- Browse the selection of pre-loved items.
- Swap your tokens for your new wardrobe pieces.
- All leftovers will be donated to charity.

## Book Swap Shop

Snuggle up this winter with a new favourite, or find some treasures to give.. There will be a dedicated Book Swap table at the Festival. Bring your old favourites and the books you bought but never read and exchange them for some exciting new books you will never read (well, we hope you will read them -- otherwise, check out these [7 Other Uses For Books Besides Reading Them](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/7-other-uses-for-books-besides-reading-them/){:target="_blank"}). As with the Clothes Swap Shop above, we will operate on "item-per-item" basis. Unclaimed books will be donated to the annual [TCD Secondhand Booksale](https://www.tcd.ie/booksale/){:target="_blank"}.

Quick rules:

- Bring your books.
- Exchange for tokens.
- Pick up new-to-you books, from the selection of other peoples past reads!
- All leftovers will be donated.
