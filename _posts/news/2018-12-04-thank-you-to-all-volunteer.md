A great thank you to all the volunteers that helped making the 2018 Zero Waste Christmas Festival at the Green Door Market in Bluebell at huge success.

We will host a Thank You meeting for any past and future volunteers, speakers and other contributors of the Zero Waste Festival on January 8, 2019, at the Generator Hostel in Smithfield. So, mark the date.
