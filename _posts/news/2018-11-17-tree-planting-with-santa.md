A refreshingly different Santa experience for you and your child.

![Tree Planting with Santa]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/events/2018-12-festival/zero-waste-tree-planting-with-santa-teaser.jpg "Tree Planting with Santa"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 250px;"}

Come along to our childrenâ€™s workshop where you will work with Santa to make a biodegradable pot and then plant your very own tree to take home with you. You will find Santa and his helpers from 11 am to 12 noon at the Festival.

As we will have to cover the costs for consumables, please book your [Tree Planting with Santa Tickets](/tickets) for only 3 EUR per child from our [tickets](/tickets) section.
