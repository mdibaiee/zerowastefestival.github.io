### Waste not want not: The danger and value of our bin content *with Brian Kelleher*

![Brian Kelleher](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/brian-kelleher.jpg "Brian Kelleher"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

Brian Kelleher is an environmental chemistry lecturer in the [School of Chemical Science, Dublin City University](https://www.dcu.ie/chemistry/people/brian-kelleher.shtml). Much of his research involves the investigation of carbon and its transformation from one medium to the next, be it during the search for extra-terrestrial life or the recycling of waste. Brian will talk about opportunities and challenges for high value solutions for municipal residual waste. Although Ireland is set to meet the 2020 European target on the decrease of municipal solid waste in landfill, the targets outlined for 2030 will require an increased diversion of waste from landfill. At present, bio-stabilised residual waste is treated as waste and only approved for disposal in landfills or by incineration, which is not sustainable and contributes towards landfill capacity. There is strong evidence that compost from such waste can enhance soil nutritional status and crop productivity. A diverse range of technologies are available to convert municipal solid waste into biofuels and/or energy outputs. And Brian will talk about some of these.

![Una Fitzgerald](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/una-fitzgerald.jpg "Una Fitzgerald"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

"People who work in labs are using approximately 15 times more plastic than the average person in Ireland", says Dr. Una Fitzgerald, the Director of the [Galway Neuroscience Centre](https://galwayneuroscience.com/) and a funded investigator in [CÚRAM](http://www.curamdevices.ie/), the SFI Research Centre for Medical Devices based at NUI Galway, which is the first research lab in Europe to be awarded [Green Lab Certification](https://www.mygreenlab.org/green-lab-certification.html), the global standard for laboratory sustainability best practice. Una will share her story of achieving this certification as part of the [Galway Green Labs initiative](https://vimeo.com/375847945) and how a lab can lead the transitions to sustainable practises across the campus to address issues such as plastic waste, energy reduction, recycling, and water usage.

### The World of Waste - how to get to Zero *with Michele Hallahan*

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpkwE5IYWAQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Michele Hallahan has worked in the fields of ecological design, environmental management and sustainability consulting for over twenty years. Starting with a global overview of sustainability in general, and some juicy waste statistics, she will explain the key confusing definitions and obstacles that trip us up when doing our best to recycle/reduce waste.  What does 'biodegradable' mean? Is 'compostable' the same as 'recyclable' (answer: NO!), and what do the symbols on our packaging mean? How do you get on the Zero Waste journey? Being the [Sustainability Advisor to the Office of the Provost](https://www.tcd.ie/provost/sustainability/) at Trinity College Dublin, Michele will answer all your questions about waste.

Join us for our panel discussion on Zero Waste Living in Dublin. We will hear what saying "No!" to single-use items and unnecessary packaging means for several of our fellow Dubliners. We are happy to have the following Zero Wasters on stage for a moderated discussion, followed by an open Q&A.

![Naomi Sheridan](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/naomi-sheridan.jpg "Naomi Sheridan"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

**Naomi Sheridan**, opened [Noms](https://www.noms.ie/) just over 14 months ago, in the hope of offering a unique shopping experience to the local northside community of Phibsborough. The shop has seen steady growth over the last few months, as more and more shoppers look to make more sustainable and ethical shopping decisions. Noms stands for Natural, Organic, Mindful and Sustainable, the four pillars which Noms is built on. As climate change and plastic pollution take centre stage, Noms offers customers the opportunity to stock up their pantry without the use of any plastic packaging. 
Naomi has spent most of her pre-noms career working in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry with major multinationals such as Mars Petcare, Heineken and General Mills, but decided after having her daughter, it was time to make a change, and look to follow a more holistic lifestyle.

**Zdenka Thunder** is a zero-waste advocate who lives in Dublin and shares her tips and tricks for 
living a more sustainable life on her platform, [Coming To Zero](https://comingtozero.com/).  If she’s not working or training on her circus skills, you’ll most likely find her in the garden trying to coax vegetables out of the ground or in the kitchen/laboratory where she passionately fills glass jars with everything and anything that couldn’t be allowed to go to waste, after all, she is a certified EPA’s Stop Food Waste trainer. Zdenka also helps to organise the Zero Waste Festival and gives the occasional workshop on practical ways to give our planet the helping hand it needs.

She has also given talks at the Airfield Food Festival, The Love your Home Show exhibit and Bloom in the Park. 

![Ciarán Smyth](/images/events/2020-01-science-gallery-festival/ciaran-smyth.jpg "Ciarán Smyth"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 20px;height: 125px;"}

**Ciarán Smyth** background is in science research, and he has been working on minimising waste and consumption since 2016. In early 2017, he and his wife Íde set up the Bring Your Own market stall to provide zero-waste shopping in Dublin and the surrounding area. At the end of 2018 he teamed up with the health and wholefoods store [Noms](https://www.noms.ie/) in Phibsborough to help with the package-free ethos of the store. He is particularly interested in minimising food waste, and trying to source as locally as possible.

### Zero Waste 101 *with Íde Mhic Gabhann*

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IcsUMdZN52o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

An introduction to Zero Waste. Íde will guide you through the 5R’s, giving tips on easy wins and long term goals. She’ll talk about how to keep motivated and the unexpected benefits! 

[Íde](/team) is 4 years into her zero waste journey, which began with the idea of a “buy nothing new” year to address her consumption and quickly escalated from there. An avid traveller, she questions what we consider “normal” and takes inspiration from aspects of sustainability from around the world. She believes that our individual actions will help shape future policy, that you can make any change if you really want to, and that every small change is victory... many of which she documents on [Instagram as Itseasyifyouwantto](https://www.instagram.com/itseasyifyouwantto/)

Have you ever wondered how much plastic has been generated in total on this planet? And how much of that plastic actually has been recycled? Which industry produces the largest amount of plastic annually? Or which polymer is the most commonly used worldwide? Come to this informative talk to learn not only about the latest facts and figures, but also about practical solutions to this global challenge. Celia will also introduce you to the [Precious Plastic universe](https://preciousplastic.com/universe/how-does-it-work.html), an alternative, grass roots, plastic recycling community.

Celia Somlai is an environmental activist and researcher who is trying to live a low impact lifestyle. She has been deeply involved with the Zero Waste movement in Dublin for the last couple of years. She is the co-founder of [Precious Plastic Dublin](https://www.preciousplasticdublin.org/), a volunteer collective working on practical solutions to plastic waste in Dublin. Her personal interest and concern about the global plastic overconsumption led to her current academic [research on Irish and European packaging waste statistics at UCD](https://rewrapped.ucd.ie/). You can follow her Zero Waste adventures on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowaste.adventures/) and her [blog](https://www.celiasomlai.com).
