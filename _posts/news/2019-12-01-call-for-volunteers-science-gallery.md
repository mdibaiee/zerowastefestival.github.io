Fancy a great start into the new? We are looking for volunteers helping us to run the upcoming Zero Waste Festival on January 25th and 26th at the Science Gallery in Dublin.

### We need you!
 
We need volunteers on the day to do various jobs from moving tables to manning doors and our beloved swap shop. In exchange for a few hours of helping out, you'll get the run of the festival, meet like-minded people and have the first pick from the swap shop.

If you are interested, please fill out the [Volunteer Form here](/forms/zwf-at-sg-2020) where you can pick your preferred role and day.

### About the Festival

The Zero Waste Festival is a non-for-profit and completely volunteer-run event that aims to help visitors to transition to a more sustainable, minimal-impact and Zero Waste lifestyle by bringing a Zero Waste themed market with vendors and info stalls, a selection of swap shops, and a series of talks and workshops to the Science Gallery. This Festival is organised as a collaboration between the [Zero Waste Festival Ireland](/), the [Science Gallery at Trinity College Dublin](https://dublin.sciencegallery.com) and the [Green Campus Committee at Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/provost/sustainability/greencampuscommittee/).

### How to sign-up for volunteering?

Please leave us your details and preferences in the form above if you would like to volunteer during the Festival. We would like to ask volunteers to commit to volunteer for at least 2 hours during any of the two days. The exact shifts will be scheduled closer to the event.
