The [Rediscovery Centre](http://www.rediscoverycentre.ie/){:target="_blank"} is a creative space connecting people, ideas and resources for greener living in Ireland.

On Wednesday the 5th of September, in line with the REUSE topic, they invite you to join them for one of their information sessions at the Boiler House, kindly sponsored by the Eastern Midlands Waste Region. 

The Rediscovery Centre is a unique educational space and an innovative experience that will demonstrate excellence in reuse for Ireland. It challenges conventional thinking about how we live, stimulates positive behavioural change and highlights how we can use our resources wisely to achieve a low carbon, sustainable society.

They have created this session for the visitors to meet the Rediscovery team and to have an informal tour of the building. As part of this information session they will demonstrate the journey of this unique building.

The agenda for the tour:

10am - Registration

10.15pm - Tour begins

11am - Tour ends

Pop in if you are around - it's a free event!
