We are looking for motivated volunteers interested in joining us and making the Zero Waste Festival Ireland and the Pop-Up Events a success. 

The Zero Waste Festival is a community-run initiative to facilitate Zero Waste networking, learning, and sharing in Ireland. We are looking for motivated and active volunteers committed to the cause and interested in the long-term development of the Festival. Don’t be shy - we are all volunteers ourselves and avid learners on our way towards Zero! 

So, no matter what floats your boat,  if you are creative or OCD, love engaging with people in person or on the web, enjoy hands-on work of contacting collaborators or prefer design work in the background, want to swap clothes and home-made food with your new friends, or are just interested in being part of a global movement towards societal change, then come to our New Volunteer Info Meetup at Trinity College on Thursday, June 27 at 6pm. You can let us know that you are coming on [volunteers@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:volunteers@zerowastefestival.ie). 

We believe that through building an inspiring and supportive community in Ireland, we can be the change  that we want to see!
