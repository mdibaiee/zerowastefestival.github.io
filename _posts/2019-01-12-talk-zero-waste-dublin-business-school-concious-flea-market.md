The Zero Waste Festival team will come to the DBS Concious Flea Market on January 14 to talk about Zero Waste living in Dublin and Ireland.

The DBS Concious Flea Market hosted at the Dublin Buisiness School's Castle House (4th floor) is a student-led initiative to raise awareness for becoming a more concious consumer. 

You will find a clothes and brick and brack flea market, a raffle, delicious baked goods and food and a talk corner includiong us and VOICE Recycling Ambassadors there. The aim of the event is to highlight ways of becoming a more conscious consumer by making a sustainable impact on a day-to day-basis. All proceeds from the event will be donated to St. Vincent De Paul (Georgeâ€™s Street).
