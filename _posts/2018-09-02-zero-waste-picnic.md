Did you ever wonder what happens to all the food in shops that can only be on the shelves until its sell-by date, even though it's perfectly edible? This food waste is massive, so members of TCD Botanical Society and TCD Environmental Society will be busy rescuing those delicious treats that have been tossed and preparing a fantastic feast to meet some new mates at! 

Come join them for a good old environmental picnic! They'll be chilling in the Rose Garden beside the Museum building on Tuesday at 12-2pm - come along and help them to REDUCE the food waste!

Afterwards they'll be heading down to the Paper Waste Campaign Launch in the Pav to hear about the campaign and to learn some nifty tricks of what to do with old paper.
