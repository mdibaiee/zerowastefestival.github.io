Sharmistha is a Yoga Instructor and a marketing executive. Her Zero Waste journey started a couple of years ago back in India when she started composting kitchen waste to grow organic veggies for her family. Sharmistha is a minimalist in the making and is currently experimenting to live with less than 30 items overall in her wardrobe. On her journey towards more sustainable living, three things are the most important for her: being aware of the implications of our lifestyle choices; making small, but continuous individual efforts into the right direction, and involving others along the way to inspire and spread the word.
