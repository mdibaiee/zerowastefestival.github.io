We teamed up with Airfield Estate for their [Festival of Food](https://www.airfield.ie/festival-of-food/){:target="_blank"} so you can meet your favourite zero waste vendors, info stands, workshops/talks and even the swap shop! All this in addition to the main event which will be fun to explore...

You will find everything from egg collecting to cow milking, lawn games to action adventure trails across 38 acres and you will experience a Food Village with over 50 local producers. You can take in the Mindful and Nature Area with Mindful Beauty from Sligo, offering yoga sessions for adults & kids.

There’ll be mindful workshops and art installations to feed the soul and you can enjoy a full programme of cooking events at the Demo Kitchen and tastings & talks at the Artisan Food Village.

Bands and performers will entertain throughout the Festival at the Music Stage and coffee will be served and roasting demoed by McCabes Roast House, Off the Cuffee Bitters and King of Kefir.

A dedicated Gardening Zone will feature demos and talks from the window box growers to the meadow mowers. This year they are looking for the hottest chilli and encouraging people to bring their homegrown efforts along, with the hope of being crowned “The Chilli King or Queen”.

For those looking to entertain and educate their families, there will be a Sustainable Systems area (where we will be based!), festival composting, backwoods cooking and food foraging from Adventure.ie plus natural beauty and cosmetics from Mindful Beauty, Sligo interspersed with fun family-friendly games.

And the best part? It's all free!
