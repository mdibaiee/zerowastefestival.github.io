Here are some impressions from our "Make It Last" Festival. With more than 200 visitors during the day, 20 info stands and market stalls, 12 talks and workshops, a repair cafe, live music, art installations and several meetups, the festival was a huge success and great opportunity for people on their Zero Waste journey to connect and share experiences. 

Thanks to all the people making this festival possible. 

The next Zero Waste Festival will take place in September 2018 in Dublin.
