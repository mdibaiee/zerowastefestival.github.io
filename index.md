# Zero Waste Festival: "Make It Last" on June 24, 2018

The Zero Waste Festival is back! With the theme "Make It Last", we will bring you a one-day festival with a market, swap-shop, info stands, talks, and workshops. 

- For the first time, our centrepiece is a Repair Cafe with [Community Reuse Network Ireland](http://crni.ie/){:target="blank"}, where you can learn how to extend the life of your stuff through simple repairs. 
- Find out how to buy to last or just give the gift of a memory to last a lifetime in our new talks. Learn how to make the tastes of summer last a little longer, by turning them into something that can be enjoyed when the summer sun is long gone - in our practical workshops. 
- Learn how to make yourself last a little longer (or at least the calm of the holiday feeling) with a yoga practice. 
- There will be kids' workshops, all with the idea of looking to the future, be that by planting trees to take home or a new love of drama. 
- We have also brought back the meet-ups and will be hosting several meet-ups this time. The idea behind a meet up is that like-minded people meet to chat informally. 

Find all the information for planning your visit below, more details to be added soon!

## Tickets

The Zero Waste Festival is a nonprofit festival run solely by volunteers. However, to bring the festival and workshops to attractive locations close to you, we have to rent premises, arrange for insurance, and reimburse our speakers and workshop leaders. That's why we have to ask a small admission charge from our visitors --- but be assured that we try to keep the prices as low as possible. If you would like to become a sponsor or partner of the festival and help to offset some of the costs, do not hesitate to get in [contact](/get-involved) with us.


Tickets are available on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/zero-waste-festival-make-it-last-tickets-46691494517){:target="blank"} and we offer three price tiers.

| Category               | Price  |   |   |   |
|------------------------|--------|---|---|---|
| Adult                  | 15 EUR |   |   |   |
| Concession             | 10 EUR |   |   |   |
| Child (up to 12 years) | free   |   |   |   |

You don't have to print your ticket, as we will accept digital tickets at the door.

Concession tickets for students, pensioners, and disabled persons -- you will need to present a valid student ID/travel pass/primary medical certificate in your name on the day to avail of the offer. Even though admission for children is free, we kindly ask you to buy a tickets for all your children in advance - that really makes it easier for us to plan ahead and offer exciting workshops for your small ones.

## Volunteer with us!

We are currently looking for volunteers helping us to organise the upcoming Zero Waste Festival: Make It Last.

Do you want to help the festival but don't have lots of time? Or maybe just want free entry to the next festival and choice of workshop? Well, the solution is here! We need volunteers on the day (24th June in St Andrews Resource Centre) to do various jobs from moving tables to manning doors. In exchange for a few hours helping out, you get a run of the festival, meet like-minded people and have a first pick at the swap shops. 

Please contact us at [volunteers@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:volunteers@zerowastefestival.ie) to get involved.

## Repair Cafe

Together with the [Community Reuse Network Ireland](http://crni.ie/){:target="blank"} and [VOICE Ireland](https://voiceireland.org/){:target="blank"} we will set up a Repair Cafe during the festival where you can learn how to extend the life of your stuff through simple repairs. This is a community event where you can bring in broken items and see how to fix them alongside expert volunteers. Repairs include electrical/electronics, wooden & general repairs, jewellery, and sewing. The overall objective is to bring back a culture of repair and support local repair businesses. So bring in your broken items and learn how to fix them.

At 11 am in the main hall, there will be native tree planting for kids and adults.

Claire and Rebecca are part of an environmental group bringing trees and plants for wildlife into urban and suburban communities around Dublin. They will go anywhere people would like to have trees and plants because every community and every place people live, work, play or spend time in can have, and need to have, trees and plants.

#### 12:00 -- 1:00 <br/> Drop-in and darn

At 12pm in the meetup area, you can learn how to darn in this drop-in workshop.

Sustainable socks are hard to come by, so make the ones you have last. No matter whether you are hard on the heels or toes, bring your worn out socks and a tennis ball to this drop-in workshop and [Celia](/team) will pass on the skills she learned from her grandmother.

### Dublin CSA

![Dublin CSA]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-external/logo-dublin-csa.png "Dublin CSA"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Community-supported agriculture (CSA) involves establishing a relationship with a farmer for a growing season. It benefits both parties in that buyers get good quality food straight from the source (no middlemen) and the farmer gets a fair price for his or her produce. The system differs from a box scheme in that the partnership is with one or a small number of producers, and all the food is sourced there –-- there’s no use of imported foods, and the emphasis is very much on local food systems. Another difference is that members take more of an active role in meeting the grower, discussing options, and possibly visiting the farm to help out as the scheme develops. Find out more about the Dublin CSA on [their website](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/){:target="blank"}.

### Revived Yarn

## Swap Shops

We will host several Swap Shops during the Festival. Please bring your pre-loved item along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

### Pre-loved Clothes Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.

### Book Swap Shop

There will be a dedicated Book Swap table at the Festival. Bring your old favourites and the books you bought but never read and exchange them for some exciting new books you will never read (well, we hope you will read them -- otherwise, check out these [7 Other Uses For Books Besides Reading Them](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/7-other-uses-for-books-besides-reading-them/){:target="_blank"}). As with the Clothes Swap Shop above, we will operate on "item-per-item" basis.
