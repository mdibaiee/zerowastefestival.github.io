# Zero Waste Festival: "Make It Last" on June 24, 2018

The Zero Waste Festival is back! With the theme "Make It Last", we will bring you a one-day festival with a market, swap-shop, info stands, talks, and workshops. 

- For the first time, our centrepiece is a Repair Cafe with [Community Reuse Network Ireland](http://crni.ie/){:target="blank"}, where you can learn how to extend the life of your stuff through simple repairs. 
- Find out how to buy to last or just give the gift of a memory to last a lifetime in our new talks. Learn how to make the tastes of summer last a little longer, by turning them into something that can be enjoyed when the summer sun is long gone - in our practical workshops. 
- Learn how to make yourself last a little longer (or at least the calm of the holiday feeling) with a yoga practice. 
- There will be kids' workshops, all with the idea of looking to the future, be that by planting trees to take home or a new love of drama. 
- We have also brought back the meet-ups and will be hosting several meet-ups this time. The idea behind a meet up is that like-minded people meet to chat informally. 

Find all the information for planning your visit below, more details to be added soon!

## Tickets

The Zero Waste Festival is a nonprofit festival run solely by volunteers. However, to bring the festival and workshops to attractive locations close to you, we have to rent premises, arrange for insurance, and reimburse our speakers and workshop leaders. That's why we have to ask a small admission charge from our visitors --- but be assured that we try to keep the prices as low as possible. If you would like to become a sponsor or partner of the festival and help to offset some of the costs, do not hesitate to get in [contact](/get-involved) with us.


Tickets are available on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/zero-waste-festival-make-it-last-tickets-46691494517){:target="blank"} and we offer three price tiers.

## Info stands

Want to find out more about leading a more sustainable life with less disposables and more fulfilment? Visit our info stands to get inspired and discuss your Zero Waste journey with organisations and practitioners dedicated to help you along the way.

### Dublin CSA

![Dublin CSA]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-external/logo-dublin-csa.png "Dublin CSA"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Community-supported agriculture (CSA) involves establishing a relationship with a farmer for a growing season. It benefits both parties in that buyers get good quality food straight from the source (no middlemen) and the farmer gets a fair price for his or her produce. The system differs from a box scheme in that the partnership is with one or a small number of producers, and all the food is sourced there –-- there’s no use of imported foods, and the emphasis is very much on local food systems. Another difference is that members take more of an active role in meeting the grower, discussing options, and possibly visiting the farm to help out as the scheme develops. Find out more about the Dublin CSA on [their website](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/){:target="blank"}.

### Revived Yarn

Revived yarn is a community of knitters and crocheters who help to warm the homeless of Dublin. They upcycle leftovers of yarn into handmade garments donated directly to the homeless on the streets.
