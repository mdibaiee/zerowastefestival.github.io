We are a community run initiative to facilitate networking learning and sharing. We aim to bring you an ongoing series of pop-up festivals with workshops, talks, screenings, and meet-up sessions taking place on a regular basis in different locations. You can meet our lovely team of dedicated volunteers here, and if you like to get involved yourself, check out the [Get Involved](/get-involved) section.

Celia has been involved with the Zero Waste Festival team from the beginning and is mainly responsible to organise the info stands at our festivals. Together with Mies, she also runs the [Zero Waste Dublin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Zero-waste-meetup-ireland/){:target="_blank"}, is a member of the [Dublin CSA (Community Supported Agriculture)](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} (Community Supported Agriculture), and volunteers at the package-free section of the [Dublin Food Coop](https://twitter.com/dublinfoodcoop){:target="_blank"}. You can follow her Zero Waste adventures on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowaste.adventures/){:target="_blank"} and her own [blog](http://celiasomlai.com/){:target="_blank"}. Her biggest enemy is disposable plastic and her favourite zero waste gadget is a jam jar. In "real life", she is trying hard to finish her PhD in Environmental Engineering.
