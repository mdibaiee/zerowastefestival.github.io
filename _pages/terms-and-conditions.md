A workshop pass entitles you to entry into any number of workshops/talks on the day, but please note that pre-sign up is available and some events may reach capacity. 
You will also be asked to vacate the room between events so that the set up can be reorganised.
We do not have the facility to process refunds, but you are welcome to pass tickets on to other people if you are unable to attend.

## Ticket types

Please do not print your tickets/workshop passes as we will only need your name/email address and ticket number to confirm your ticket on the day. You can either show us your confirmation email directly on your phone/tablet or write down your ticket number with old school pen and paper. That will be enough. 

### Standard Workshop Pass

The Standard Workshop Pass costs 10 EUR and will allow you access to all pre-booked workshops/talks. Please select the workshops/talks you would like to visit during the booking process as this will guarantee you a seat in the workshop/talk. There will only be a limited number of seats available for any given workshop/talk, depending on the venue capacity. If a specific workshop/talk is fully booked we will try arrange for an additional run, but we cannot guarantee that we will always be able to do so. Remaining seats can be taken up by anyone with a workshop pass on the day of the event on a first-come-first-serve basis. Please also note, in order to create a nice experience for everyone, we cannot allow people into a workshop/talk that has already started - so please be at the indicated location of the workshop/talk at least 5 minutes before it starts. 

You should receive your email booking confirmation/electronic ticket within 24 hours of your booking. Please check your spam folder if you haven't received your ticket within this time and send us an email at [info@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:info@zerowastefestival.ie) if you have any further questions.

Remaining tickets will be available at the door on the day of the event but note that some workshops might already be fully booked and we cannot guarantee that you will be able to see all the workshops/talks without prior pre-booking on our website. 

### Concession Workshop Pass

The Concession Workshop Pass will cost 8 EUR and entitles you to the same as the Standard Workshop Pass above. Concession Workshop Passes are available for students, pensioners, and persons with disabilities â€“ you will need to present a valid student ID/travel pass/primary medical certificate in your name on the day to avail of the offer.

### Child's Workshop Pass

Admission for children is free. If you like for your little one to participate in our Planting Christmas Trees with Santa workshop, then purchase a Child's Workshop Pass for 3 EUR. This will help us cover the costs for providing you with a Zero--Waste--friendly Christmas Tree planting experience and your child can take it's newly planted tree and decorated pot home.

### Press Pass

We have a limited number of free press passes available -- just drop us an email at [info@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:info@zerowastefestival.ie) for more information. 


## Code of Conduct

Our Zero Waste Festival is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of and by any of our visitors, volunteers, and market stall/info stand personnel in any form. As we aim to be a family--friendly event, sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including talks, workshops, and social media. Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the venue without a refund at the discretion of the festival organisers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a festival volunteer or organiser immediately. Volunteers and organisers can be easily identified as they'll be wearing Zero Waste Festival badges.

We are very happy for you take photos at the festival and share them on our or your social media with the hashtag #ZeroWasteFestival

Under any circumstances, please be considerate of your peers and be aware that not everyone (especially visitors and their children) is comfortable with having their picture taken during the event.
