## What to bring?

### For notes

There'll be no leaflets or business cards, so bring your phone, a camera or pen and paper.

### For shopping

You'll need your own containers, beeswax wrap, cotton bag, etc. for loose goods and refills and bring some bags to carry your purchases home.

### For food and drinks

Bring your own mug, water bottle, lunch box and utensils. The [Science Gallery Cafe](https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/cafe) and the [Forum at the Trinity Buisness School](https://www.forumdublin.ie/) will offer a 40 cent discount during the weekend if you bring your own mug and food container on coffee, hot drinks and food that you take with you.

### Stuff to swap/share/donate

- Clean and wearable men's, women's and kid's clothes for the swap shop
- Spare jars can be useful for other people who didn't bring enough
- Bring any take-away containers you have built up to share in case people are short
