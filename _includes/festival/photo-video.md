## Photo and video recording

We are very happy if you take photos at the festival and share them on our or your social media with the hashtags **#ZWF2020SG #SustainableTrinity #SGPlastic #ZeroWasteFestival**

If you would like to record videos (private and to share), please talk to us in advance or ask any of the organizers during the day. Just drop us an email at [info@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:info@zerowastefestival.ie).

Under any circumstances, please be considerate of your peers and be aware that not everyone (especially visitors and their children) is comfortable with having their picture taken during the event.

We will be taking photos and recording short videos during the event itself to share on our website and social media. Feel free to talk to our volunteers during the day if you do not want to appear in our photos or recordings.
