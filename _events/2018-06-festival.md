# Zero Waste Festival: "Make It Last" on June 24, 2018

Below you will find all the information concerning the "Make It Last" Festival.

{% include toc.html %}

The Zero Waste Festival is back! With the theme "Make It Last", we will bring you a one-day festival with a market, swap-shop, info stands, talks, and workshops. 

- For the first time, our centrepiece is a Repair Cafe where you can learn how to extend the life of your stuff through simple repairs. 
- Find out how to buy to last or just give the gift of a memory to last a lifetime in our new talks. Learn how to make the tastes of summer last a little longer, by turning them into something that can be enjoyed when the summer sun is long gone - in our practical workshops. 
- Learn how to make yourself last a little longer (or at least the calm of the holiday feeling) with a yoga practice. 
- There will be kids' workshops, all with the idea of looking to the future, be that by planting trees to take home or a new love of drama. 
- We have also brought back the meet-ups and will be hosting several meet-ups this time. The idea behind a meet up is that like-minded people meet to chat informally. 

Find all the information for planning your visit below!

Spaces for talks and workshops are limited. Buying a ticket early entitles you to advanced sign up for your preferred talk/workshop (details will be sent to you by email when purchasing a ticket). Limited places may be left on the day itself and are given away on first-come first-serve basis.

## Tickets

The Zero Waste Festival is a nonprofit festival run solely by volunteers. However, to bring the festival and workshops to attractive locations close to you, we have to rent premises, arrange for insurance, and reimburse our speakers and workshop leaders. That's why we have to ask a small admission charge from our visitors --- but be assured that we try to keep the prices as low as possible. If you would like to become a sponsor or partner of the festival and help to offset some of the costs, do not hesitate to get in [contact](/get-involved) with us.


Tickets are available on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/zero-waste-festival-make-it-last-tickets-46691494517){:target="blank"} and we offer three price tiers.

## Volunteer with us!

We are currently looking for volunteers helping us to organise the upcoming Zero Waste Festival: Make It Last.

Do you want to help the festival but don't have lots of time? Or maybe just want free entry to the next festival and choice of workshop? Well, the solution is here! We need volunteers on the day (24th June in St Andrews Resource Centre) to do various jobs from moving tables to manning doors. In exchange for a few hours helping out, you get a run of the festival, meet like-minded people and have a first pick at the swap shops. 

Spaces for talks and workshops are limited. Buying a ticket early entitles you to advanced sign up for your preferred talk/workshop (details will be sent to you by email when purchasing a ticket). Limited places may be left on the day itself and are given away on first-come first-serve basis.

Please contact us at [volunteers@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:volunteers@zerowastefestival.ie) to get involved.

## Repair Cafe

Together with [VOICE Ireland](https://voiceireland.org/){:target="blank"} we will set up a Repair Cafe during the festival where you can learn how to extend the life of your stuff through simple repairs. This is a community event where you can bring in broken items and see how to fix them alongside expert volunteers. Repairs include electrical/electronics, wooden & general repairs, jewellery, and sewing. The overall objective is to bring back a culture of repair and support local repair businesses. So bring in your broken items and learn how to fix them.

## DIY Corner

#### 11:00 -- 12:00 <br/> Native Irish tree plant and adopt

At 11 am in the main hall, there will be native tree planting for kids and adults. 

Discover how tree folklore and our fairy friends can teach us lots about taking care of trees and how trees grow. Find out how in Ireland we once had a tree calendar. Write a tree poem or create some tree-art: zero waste just art! Turn rubbish into pots for tree saplings and take a tree sapling home with you! 

Claire and Rebecca are part of an environmental group bringing trees and plants for wildlife into urban and suburban communities around Dublin. They will go anywhere people would like to have trees and plants because every community and every place people live, work, play or spend time in can have, and need to have, trees and plants.

#### 1:00 -- 4:00 <br/> Repair Cafe

### Room 2

#### 10:00 -- 11:00 <br/> The Change Machine - Drama for kids <a name="drama"></a>

At 10am in Room 2, we will have a fun and engaging Practical Drama Workshop for children. It aims to engage participants on the topic of Zero Waste and the current challenges that face our society, while focusing on changes we can all make in our daily lives. It takes this daunting subject and brings it into a tangible more accessible context that gives the children empowerment and passion to instigate change, using drama devices to create a relaxed and interactive learning environment that promotes self-development, creativity and peer learning. Suitable for kids 8-14 years. 

Find the workshop/talk on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/375356999641320/){:target="_blank"}.

Diane O'Connor is a qualified drama facilitator, with extensive and diverse experience; Drama in Education, Special Ed, Youth Theatre, Adult Education and Community Drama. She received a higher diploma for Drama and Theatre Studies from UCD. She is also a comedian with training in Improvisation both long and short form. She performs regularly around Ireland and also produces shows. Diane is very excited about this workshop which brings her passion for the environment together with her love Drama. 

#### 11:00 -- 12:00 <br/> Foraged feasts <a name="foraged"></a>

At 11am in Room 2, [Mies and Molly](/team) from [Wildflower Walks Ireland](https://www.facebook.com/WildflowerWalksIreland/){:target="_blank"} will be talking about foraging. The internet tells us that summer is all about sunshine, barbecues, and fresh salads. Now we all know that plastic is not so fantastic, and perhaps your green fingers are more thumbs of death. So how to get your leaves zero waste? The good news is that Ireland has 40 shades of green and at least some of them are edible. Come along to this workshop to sample some examples, and learn how to make the most of your nature walks. Foraging can stretch out your shopping budget and your legs in the fresh air. (Sunshine cannot be guaranteed.) If salads are not your thing we will also be looking at desserts, drinks and other substantial delights complete with tasters.

Wildflower walks Ireland is a two person team made up of long time friends Mies Stam and Molly Aylesbury. Mies is a third generation horticulturist who has been helping out on her parents nurseries both here and in the Netherlands since she could walk. It is no surprise that she studied horticulture and then later a BSc. in Botany in UCD. It was there that Mies and Molly met. Molly, a lifelong tree-hugger, got her BSc. in Environmental Biology before leaving to study her masters in Sustainable Development in Sweden. Together they run Wildflower Walks Ireland, and are dedicated to showing people a little of the wild that is around them, our native biodiversity and what everyone can do to be more sustainable. They hold regular wildflower identification walks, foraging and green living workshops. You can find the details of their events on their [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/Wildflower-Walks-Ireland/){:target="_blank"}.

#### 12:00 -- 1:00 <br/> Living lightly - Craft for kids <a name="craft"></a>

At 12pm in Room 2, Elaine will give a crafts workshop for kids. Start the kids on their zero waste journey with some low-waste crafts made with compostable and reusable materials. We'll be making paper masks and paper air planes, building compostable structures, and learning to write secret spy messages. There's also a Duplo Lego pile for any kiddies that prefer free play! This workshop is suitable for kids aged 3+ years as long as the parents are present. 

Elaine is a designer who writes a blog on sustainable living called [Living Lightly in Ireland](https://livinglightlyinireland.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"}.

#### 1:00 -- 2:00 <br/> Cleaning for keeps <a name="cleaning"></a>

More infos on this workshop/talks coming soon.

At 1pm in Room 2, Molly will be talking about keeping up appliances (and other items) to make sure they have a long lifespan. When Molly was a kid she imagined life would be super exciting as an adult. She did not foresee the endless life of washing that was ahead! How we wash things has consequences too! What are the stakes you ask? Well how you take care of your stuff directly affects its lifespan. If you have a minimalist wardrobe, knowing good garment care is a must so that your only pair of jeans look amazing! Is your dishwasher broken or have you just not cleaned it? Likewise for your washing machine! Avoid buying new stuff and extend the life of your current stuff by learning how to take care of the things we never think of like jewelry, our mattresses, the couch. Come along to learn more or to share more adulting tips. Even Molly may need to take notes!

Molly is a lifelong tree-hugger who is constantly experimenting with growing-her-own, making-her-own and general doing-it-herself. She has been on her zero waste journey a while now, and while not perfect, with a happy sourdough, zero waste beauty regime, and the best popcorn recipe ever, she is happy with her progress! She is one half of the Zero Waste business [Bare Necessities Ireland](https://www.facebook.com/BareNecessitiesIreland/){:target="_blank"} and Wildflower Walks Ireland and manages the blog [Confessions of a part time hippy](https://confessionsofaparttimehippy.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} where she is happy to chat about zero waste cleaning, cooking, beauty or broader environmental issues. 

Find the workshop/talk on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/2229503910401721/){:target="_blank"}.


#### 2:00 -- 3:00 <br/> Buy to last <a name="buy"></a>

A light bulb that lasts a hundred years? Ear phones you probably loose before they break? A decade's supply of shaving soap?

There are many (durable and long-lasting) alternatives to the quick and cheap buys we encounter most of the time. In this talk, we will discuss some strategies to spot planned obsolescence, assess repairability, and fight fast fashion by looking at examples from everyday household items, to home electronics, white goods, and clothes. In the long run, buying to last will save money, stress, and the planet. If you want to learn more, come and join us for this talk in Room 2 at 2pm.

The talk is hosted by [Jan](/team). He is an environmental scientist with an undeniable passion for nature, sustainability, and quirky facts. E.g., did you know that reports indicate we consume twice as many material goods today as we did 50 years ago and that the average 10-year-old in Britain owns 238 toys but plays with just 12 of them daily? You can find more about Jan's work on sustainable sanitation on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janknappe){:target="blank"} and his [blog](https://www.janknappe.com/){:target="blank"}.

#### 3:00 -- 4:00 <br/> The Endy Bit - Eat everything <a name="endy"></a>

At 3pm in Room 2 Anne from [The Endy Bit](https://www.facebook.com/theendybit/){:target="_blank"} will guide you through a process of avoiding food waste, sharing stories, ideas and food with you. What is your top food waste issue? Share at the talk and maybe find some answers.

Find the workshop/talk on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/1052796314868691/){:target="_blank"}.

Anne Hession is a working mother/project management nerd who likes cooking and avoiding food waste. She posts about her attempts to eat everything on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theendybit/){:target="_blank"} and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theendybit/){:target="_blank"}.


### Room 3

#### 10:00 -- 11:00 <br/> Satisfying Breakfast <a name="breakfast"></a>

At 10am in Room 3, Laetitia will show you how to skip the mid-morning sugar crash. Wake up to a healthy morning meal and start your day feeling full and energized with the help of a fresh breakfast bowl. 

Find the workshop/talk on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/events/170619740276342/){:target="_blank"}.

Laetitia moved to Ireland from her native France almost 2 years ago. Her heart wasn't in her original career in HR and asset management, so she retrained and started her own catering business. In Dublin she volunteered with the Dublin Food Coop launching their package free section, has organised buyers clubs, beach and street clean ups and demonstrations around the city and supports the work of Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, as well as being actively involved with the Zero Waste Festival. She believes we are the change we want to see in this world. And knows from experience what starts as a challenge can become a habit, and we can minimize our impact on the environment. Because its worth it!


#### 11:00 -- 12:00 <br/> Balance Hatha Yoga <a name="yoga"></a>

At 11am in Room 3, there will be Balance Hatha Yoga. Yoga and the yogic way of life is the perfect antidote to today’s fast-paced life. In this balanced Hatha Yoga class, take a pause from your hectic life, become aware of your physical postures and connect with your breath. **Please wear comfy clothes and bring a yoga mat if you can.**

[Sharmistha](/team) became a dedicated yoga practitioner after a back injury in 2003. Her passion towards yoga kept growing and finally after a corporate stint of 8 years she answered her calling to pursue yoga full time. She went on to become a certified yoga teacher in 2017 and started teaching Yoga in India. She primarily practices and teaches Hatha yoga, and believes that the overall yogic way of life helps us to preserve our overall health and brings balance to the mind-body-soul. You can follow her on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/omywellness/){:target="_blank"}.

#### 12:00 -- 1:00 <br/> You can can! <a name="can"></a>

At 12 noon in Room 3, Timi will be giving you an introduction to preserving food by canning. Timi is passionate about sustainable living: Astonished by the amount of disposable nappies they had to throw away every day when their son entered their lives, her family began their zero waste journey. Soon after transitioning to cloth nappies, they got rid of all disposable products in their house, and 9 months down the line, were able to completely unsubscribe from bin services.
Since then, Timi has been featured in major publications such as the Irish Examiner and Greennews.ie, in addition to appearing on Eco Eye, Ireland’s longest running environmental programme. She has given several talks on eco-friendly habits and Zero Waste Living at different forums from the Earth Baby Fair to LinkedIn’s headquarters in Dublin, including several at Zero Waste Festivals.

#### 1:00 -- 2:00 <br/> Do stuff, don't buy stuff! <a name="dostuff"></a>

At 1pm in Room 3, Íde will be talking about choosing experience over buying items. We are often caught in the trap of wanting and feeling we need more possessions. Choosing experiences instead, not only is better for keeping those purchase away from their inevitable destination in the bin, but also give us a more lasting feeling of happiness.

Íde stopped buying CDs when they started to cost more than Ryanair flights, and although in the intervening years she has tried to be more conscious of her carbon footprint, she has travelled far and enjoyed some great adventures closer to home.

#### 2:00 -- 3:00 <br/> Pickles & Ferments <a name="pickles"></a>

At 2pm in Room 3, Zdenka from [Coming to Zero](https://comingtozero.com){:target="_blank"} will be talking about pickles and ferments. In the quest to prevent food waste, forgotten skills like fermenting and pickling come in very handy. Make a delicious and super-healthy sauerkraut before that cabbage goes bad, get past the misconception that pickles are weird and inedible sour foods of post-war Eastern Europe and learn how to save money and packaging waste by making your own vegetable condiments.

### Dublin CSA

![Dublin CSA]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-external/logo-dublin-csa.png "Dublin CSA"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Community-supported agriculture (CSA) involves establishing a relationship with a farmer for a growing season. It benefits both parties in that buyers get good quality food straight from the source (no middlemen) and the farmer gets a fair price for his or her produce. The system differs from a box scheme in that the partnership is with one or a small number of producers, and all the food is sourced there –-- there’s no use of imported foods, and the emphasis is very much on local food systems. Another difference is that members take more of an active role in meeting the grower, discussing options, and possibly visiting the farm to help out as the scheme develops. Find out more about the Dublin CSA on [their website](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/){:target="blank"}.

## Swap Shops

We will host several Swap Shops during the Festival. Please bring your pre-loved item along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

### Pre-loved Clothes Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.

### Book Swap Shop

There will be a dedicated Book Swap table at the Festival. Bring your old favourites and the books you bought but never read and exchange them for some exciting new books you will never read (well, we hope you will read them -- otherwise, check out these [7 Other Uses For Books Besides Reading Them](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/7-other-uses-for-books-besides-reading-them/){:target="_blank"}). As with the Clothes Swap Shop above, we will operate on "item-per-item" basis.

## Art Exhibition

![Mopompo]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-external/logo-mopompo.jpg "Mopompo"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Upstairs we will have an art exhibition titled 'No Planet B' by Mopompo, who are raising awareness about various environmental crises including plastic pollution. They are a brand created by Polish-born, Ireland-based Monika McDonnell.

Hand painted wooden furniture and functional home decor items are some of the early artwork created over the last couple of years. Mopompo's most recent and ongoing project is a collection of mixed-media art pieces, created with driftwood, plastic, metal and fabric litter found on beaches in Portmarnock and Malahide, combined with household throwaways. The collection is exhibited under the title "No Planet B" and hopes to raise awareness about the human impact on the environment through blind expansion, overproduction, intensive pollution and disregard for wildlife. I encourages a shift from overconsumption to a conscious, zero-waste living, focused on creative reuse, recycling and protection of nature.
Mopompo's projects can be viewed and followed on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MopompoArt/){:target="blank"} and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mopompoart/){:target="blank"}.
