The Zero Waste Festival is back! The next festival takes place 10 am to 5 pm on Sunday 2nd December at the [Green Door Market in Bluebell Business Park, Dublin 12](#venue). With this year's Christmas-themed festival in December, we will bring you a one-day festival with market, swap-shops, info stands, meet-ups, talks, and workshops all dedicated to helping you reduce your waste this Christmas.

Christmas can be a difficult time to keep your bins empty and your recycling pile small, but during this day-long event you will get tips on cutting down on waste from food and packaging, gifts and wrapping, decorations and festive dressing and even pre-Christmas cleaning! From making better choices of materials to reusing and upcycling what is already created, there will be something to be learned for everyone, no matter where you are on your journey. For your first foray into Zero Waste, stop by our info-stand for a quick primer or sign up for a Talk/Workshop Pass for more insight.

Find all the information for planning your visit below and check out the [press release](/zero-waste-christmas-festival-press-release.pdf) if you would like to talk about our awesome festival on your blog, local news, radio station, etc.

Please note that places for talks and workshops are limited. Securing your Pass early entitles you to advanced sign up for your preferred workshops/talks.

The Green Door Market is located indoors at Unit A1, Bluebell Business Centre, Old Naas Road, Dublin 12. And guess what? The door is green so keep your eyes open for it.

Why not help them live in the moment by giving them the gift of a wonderful experience, instead?

Ditch the "stuff", and still get that all-important list sorted by Christmas eve, it's a win-win! 

This talk ist hosted by Sinéad. She is a musician and composer with a strong interest in the environment and climate action in particular. She has previously worked with WWF's Earth Hour initiative here in Ireland, and has completed training with Eco Unesco on Education for Sustainable Development from an environmental perspective.

#### 3:00 -- 4:00 <br/> Buy to Last <a name="buy"></a>

A light bulb that lasts a hundred years? Electronics you probably lose before they break? A decade’s supply of shaving soap? There are many (durable and long-lasting) alternatives to the quick and cheap buys we encounter most of the time. In this talk, Jan will discuss some strategies to spot planned obsolescence, assess repairability, and fight fast fashion by looking at examples from everyday household items, to home electronics, white goods, and clothes. In the long run, buying to last will save money, time, stress, and the planet. If you want to learn more, come and join us for this talk in Room 2 at 3 pm.

This talk is hosted by [Jan](https://www.janknappe.com). He is an environmental researcher here in Dublin, part of the [Zero Waste Festival organising team](/team) and has an undeniable passion for nature, sustainability, and quirky facts. E.g., did you know that the average 10-year-old in Britain owns 238 toys but plays with just 12 of them daily?

![Lilly's Eco-Clean]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-external/logo-lillys-ecoclean.jpg "Lilly's Eco-Clean"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Lilly's Eco Clean manufactures a range of natural cleaning products right here in Dublin. Since the beginning, the company has been doing their best to reduce waste. Bottles are made out of post consumer recycled plastics. Boxes as packed with paper tape and practically every element related to production is re-used as best as possible. The company started waste reduction in household thinking early and refills were made available from the day one. Today, Lilly's product containers can be re-used in many ways so that everyone can do it, either by bringing Lilly's bottle or any bottle for refilling, get a refill pouch that reduces both waste and carbon foot print or using containers or sharing them with friends. For more info, check out their [website](https://www.lillysecoclean.com){:target="_blank"}, [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/lillysecoclean){:target="_blank"}, or [facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/lillysecoproducts){:target="_blank"}.

## Info stands

Want to find out more about leading a more sustainable life with less disposables and more fulfilment? Visit our info stands to get inspired and discuss your Zero Waste journey with organisations and practitioners dedicated to help you along the way.

### Dublin CSA

![Dublin CSA]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-external/logo-dublin-csa.png "Dublin CSA"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Community-supported agriculture (CSA) involves establishing a relationship with a farmer for a growing season. It benefits both parties in that buyers get good quality food straight from the source (no middlemen) and the farmer gets a fair price for his or her produce. The system differs from a box scheme in that the partnership is with one or a small number of producers, and all the food is sourced there –-- there’s no use of imported foods, and the emphasis is very much on local food systems. Another difference is that members take more of an active role in meeting the grower, discussing options, and possibly visiting the farm to help out as the scheme develops. Find out more about the Dublin CSA on [their website](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/).

### Revived Yarn

![Revived Yarn]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-external/logo-revived-yarn.png "Revived Yarn"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Revived yarn is a community of knitters and crocheters who help to warm the homeless of Dublin. They upcycle leftovers of yarn into handmade garments donated directly to the homeless on the streets. Find out more about Revived Yarn on their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/revivedyarn).

## Swap Shops

There will be three swaps hops at this Christmas Edition of the Zero Waste Festival. Our very successful Clothes Swap, back by popular demand. Get ready for the party season with some new to you outfits (and maybe even get a few gifts)!So, please bring your pre-loved item along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

### Pre-loved Clothes Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.

### Book Swap Shop

There will be a dedicated Book Swap table at the Festival. Bring your old favourites and the books you bought but never read and exchange them for some exciting new books you will never read (well, we hope you will read them -- otherwise, check out these [7 Other Uses For Books Besides Reading Them](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/7-other-uses-for-books-besides-reading-them/){:target="_blank"}). As with the Clothes Swap Shop above, we will operate on "item-per-item" basis. Unclaimed books will be donated to the annual [TCD Secondhand Booksale](https://www.tcd.ie/booksale/).

### Christmas Decoration Swap Shop

Get your home ready for the holidays, and maybe pick up a few bits for creative gift wrapping. Bring any Christmas decorations that don't fit in your life. Exchange for tokens. Browse the selection and take home decorations that you love! All leftovers will be donated to charity.
