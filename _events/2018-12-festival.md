The Zero Waste Festival is back! The next festival takes place from 10 am to 5 pm on Sunday, December 2, at the [Green Door Market in Bluebell Business Park, Dublin 12](#venue). With this year's Christmas-themed festival in December, we will bring you a one-day festival with market, swap-shops, info stands, talks, and workshops all dedicated to helping you reduce your waste this Christmas and meet like-minded people.

Christmas can be a difficult time to keep your bins empty and your recycling pile small, but during this day-long event you will get tips on cutting down on waste from food and packaging, gifts and wrapping, decorations and festive dressing and even pre-Christmas cleaning! From making better choices of materials to reusing and upcycling what is already created, there will be something to be learned for everyone, no matter where you are on your journey. For your first foray into Zero Waste, stop by our info-stand for a quick primer or sign up for a Talk/Workshop Pass for more insight.

Find all the information for planning your visit below and check out the [press release](/zero-waste-christmas-festival-press-release.pdf) if you would like to talk about our awesome festival on your blog, local news, radio station, etc.

Lots of gift suggestions for various ages, interests and budgets, while positively impacting the planet along the way! So many people these days seem to have everything they need already. Why not help them live in the moment by giving them the gift of a wonderful experience, instead? You'll reduce the burden on our planet, and the excess of unwanted consumer products around the holidays, which clog up our lives, and later, our landfill sites and oceans! Ditch the "stuff", and still get that all-important list sorted by Christmas eve, it's a win-win! 

This talk ist hosted by Sinéad. She is a musician and composer with a strong interest in the environment and climate action in particular.

A light bulb that lasts a hundred years? Electronics you probably lose before they break? A decade’s supply of shaving soap? There are many (durable and long-lasting) alternatives to the quick and cheap buys we encounter most of the time. In this talk, Jan will discuss some strategies to spot planned obsolescence, assess repairability, and fight fast fashion by looking at examples from everyday household items, to home electronics, white goods, and clothes. In the long run, buying to last will save money, time, stress, and the planet. If you want to learn more, come and join us for this talk in Room 2 at 3 pm.

This talk is hosted by [Jan](https://www.janknappe.com). He is an environmental researcher here in Dublin, part of the [Zero Waste Festival organising team](/team) and has an undeniable passion for nature, sustainability, and quirky facts. E.g., did you know that the average 10-year-old in Britain owns 238 toys but plays with just 12 of them daily?

### Dublin CSA

![Dublin CSA]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logos-external/logo-dublin-csa.png "Dublin CSA"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Community-supported agriculture (CSA) involves establishing a relationship with a farmer for a growing season. It benefits both parties in that buyers get good quality food straight from the source (no middlemen) and the farmer gets a fair price for his or her produce. The system differs from a box scheme in that the partnership is with one or a small number of producers, and all the food is sourced there –-- there’s no use of imported foods, and the emphasis is very much on local food systems. Another difference is that members take more of an active role in meeting the grower, discussing options, and possibly visiting the farm to help out as the scheme develops. Find out more about the Dublin CSA on [their website](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/).

### EcoEat

![EcoEat]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/events/2018-12-festival/teaser-ecoeat.jpg "EcoEat"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 200px;"}

## Swap Shops

There will be three swaps hops at this Christmas Edition of the Zero Waste Festival, back by popular demand. So, please bring your pre-loved items along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

### Pre-loved Clothes Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.

### Book Swap Shop

There will be a dedicated Book Swap table at the Festival. Bring your old favourites and the books you bought but never read and exchange them for some exciting new books you will never read (well, we hope you will read them -- otherwise, check out these [7 Other Uses For Books Besides Reading Them](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/7-other-uses-for-books-besides-reading-them/){:target="_blank"}). As with the Clothes Swap Shop above, we will operate on "item-per-item" basis. Unclaimed books will be donated to the annual [TCD Secondhand Booksale](https://www.tcd.ie/booksale/).

### Christmas Decoration Swap Shop

Get your home ready for the holidays, and maybe pick up a few bits for creative gift wrapping. Bring any Christmas decorations that don't fit in your life. Exchange for tokens. Browse the selection and take home decorations that you love! All leftovers will be donated to charity.

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


## Make Space

We will host a selected range of hands-on workshops and events in our Make Space this time. Please note, that some events need prior registration (as we have to organise material and wouldn't want anything to waste, after all).

### 11:00 -- 12:00 <br/> Tree-planting With Santa

A refreshingly different Santa experience for you and your child. Come along to our children’s workshop at the Make Space where you will work with Santa and his helpers to make a biodegradable pot and, then, plant your very own tree to take home with you.

Please note, that a separate ticket will be required for each child for the Planting Trees with Santa workshop to help us cover Santa's milk and cookies. You can sign up and get your ticket in our [tickets](/tickets) section. 

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


###  12:30 -- 2:00 <br/> Learn to Knit with Revived Yarn

Revived Yarn will host a beginner's knitting workshop at the upcoming Zero Waste Christmas Festival. If you would like to give back and help them to warm the homeless but you don't know how to knit or you are a beginner, this workshop is for you! In this class you will receive a kit containing the yarn to be upcycled and a pattern. You will learn the basic stitches of knitting and all the steps to make a simple and fashionable item for the homeless. Sign up for free [here](/2018-12-festival/learn-knit-homeless-revived-yarn) if you would like to learn how to make simple and fashionable items for the homeless.
