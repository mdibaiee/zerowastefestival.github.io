The Zero Waste Festival is back! The next festival takes place from 10 am to 5 pm on Sunday, December 2, at the [Green Door Market in Bluebell Business Park, Dublin 12](#venue). With this year's Christmas-themed festival in December, we will bring you a one-day festival with market, swap-shops, info stands, talks, and workshops all dedicated to helping you reduce your waste this Christmas and meet like-minded people.

Christmas can be a difficult time to keep your bins empty and your recycling pile small, but during this day-long event you will get tips on cutting down on waste from food and packaging, gifts and wrapping, decorations and festive dressing and even pre-Christmas cleaning! From making better choices of materials to reusing and upcycling what is already created, there will be something to be learned for everyone, no matter where you are on your journey. For your first foray into Zero Waste, stop by our info-stand for a quick primer or sign up for a Talk/Workshop Pass for more insight.

Find all the information for planning your visit below and check out the [press release](/zero-waste-christmas-festival-press-release.pdf) if you would like to talk about our awesome festival on your blog, local news, radio station, etc.

##### 3:00 -- 4:00 <br/> Bath and Beyond: Stocking Fillers

There is a simple solution at hand though. Making your own is easy! Even the generic fall back of bath sets looks thoughtful when you make it yourself! Join this workshop to learn how to make beauty treats and sample before you gift! For the ladies in your life there are vegan lotion bars, body scrubs and other delicious potions and lotions! If the men in your life have gotten shaving sets for all their Christmases no need to change! For the smooth-cheeked there will be shaving cream and the bearded gentlemen can have beard balm and oil! Not an upset rang-tan in sight either! Have a hippy Christmas! The workshop will be led by Molly Aylesbury. She has spent her life making-her-own, growing-her-own and doing-it-herself. Molly makes most of her own food, beauty and cleaning products with friends as usually willing guinea pigs. All of this naturally led her to the Zero Waste lifestyle, beginning her journey 3 years ago. Since then she has fully embraced it, opening a Zero Waste stall Bare Necessities Ireland with her best friend and accomplice Mies Stam. She also holds workshops and talks about living greener as well as being one half of Wildflower Walks Ireland teaching people the value of our native flora.

A light bulb that lasts a hundred years? Electronics you probably lose before they break? A decade’s supply of shaving soap? There are many (durable and long-lasting) alternatives to the quick and cheap buys we encounter most of the time. In this talk, Jan will discuss some strategies to spot planned obsolescence, assess repairability, and fight fast fashion by looking at examples from everyday household items, to home electronics, white goods, and clothes. In the long run, buying to last will save money, time, stress, and the planet.  This talk is hosted by [Jan](https://www.janknappe.com), an environmental researcher here in Dublin.

The system differs from a box scheme in that the partnership is with one or a small number of producers, and all the food is sourced there –-- there’s no use of imported foods, and the emphasis is very much on local food systems. Members will take an active role in meeting the grower, discussing options, and possibly visiting the farm to help out as the scheme develops.

### Swap Shops

There will be three swaps hops at this Christmas Edition of the Zero Waste Festival, back by popular demand. So, please bring your pre-loved items along, drop them off with our volunteers, and pick up what you need from the Swap Shop.

#### Pre-loved Clothes Swap Shop

Bring your washed, and wearable clothes, shoes, and accessories to the festival. The Swap Shop will work on an item-by-item basis, i.e., for every item you bring, you will get one token that you can exchange for any other item in the Swap Shop. Since we will re-stock the Swap Shop continuously as people drop off new items, it's worth checking it out from time to time in between the talks and workshops. All unclaimed items will be donated to a local charity shop at the end of the day.

#### Book Swap Shop

There will be a dedicated Book Swap table at the Festival. Bring your old favourites and the books you bought but never read and exchange them for some exciting new books you will never read (well, we hope you will read them -- otherwise, check out these [7 Other Uses For Books Besides Reading Them](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/7-other-uses-for-books-besides-reading-them/){:target="_blank"}). As with the Clothes Swap Shop above, we will operate on "item-per-item" basis. Unclaimed books will be donated to the annual [TCD Secondhand Booksale](https://www.tcd.ie/booksale/).

#### Christmas Decoration Swap Shop

Get your home ready for the holidays, and maybe pick up a few bits for creative gift wrapping. Bring any Christmas decorations that don't fit in your life. Exchange for tokens. Browse the selection and take home decorations that you love! All leftovers will be donated to charity.

<a href="#top">Back to top</a>


### Make Space

# Photo and video recording

We are very happy if you take photos at the festival and share them on our or your social media with the hashtags #ZeroWasteFestival

If you would like to record videos (private and to share), please talk to us in advance or ask any of the organizers during the day. We also have press passes (with free entry) available -- just drop us an email at [info@zerowastefestival.ie](mailto:info@zerowastefestival.ie).

Under any circumstances, please be considerate of your peers and be aware that not everyone (especially visitors and their children) is comfortable with having their picture taken during the event.

We will be taking photos and recording short videos during the event itself to share on our website and social media. Feel free to talk to our volunteers during the day if you do not want to appear in any photos or recordings.
